The person does not change speed or direction.</li><li>If the person in the above example is in a moving car, which suddenly brakes, the person will continue to move forward until they are stopped by the seat in front of them: the person resists any change in motion until acted on by an external force (the seat in front)</li></ul></li><li>A more massive object therefore needs more force to reach the same acceleration as a less massive object.</li></ul><h2>Second Law</h2><blockquote>Force is equal to mass times acceleration</blockquote><ul><li>This is expressed mathematically as \(F=ma\)<ul><li>F: Force in Newtons (N)</li><li>m: Mass in Kilograms (kg)</li><li>a: Acceleration in Meters per Second squared \(m/s^2\)</li></ul></li></ul><h2>Third Law</h2><blockquote>Every Action has an Equal but Opposite Reaction</blockquote><ul><li>The reaction force is known as the NORMAL FORCE</li><li>The Normal force always acts perpendicular (at \(90^\circ\)) to the surface that your object is on</li><li>The Normal force changes magnitude based on the force that it is attempting to balance</li></ul><h2>Video: Newton’s Laws Crash Course (11 minutes)</h2><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/kKKM8Y-u7ds" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>]]></content>

The ritual is performed symbolically at public events, but also<br>during other traditional uses such as smoking ceremonies</li></ul></li><li>Totems carry ceremonial responsibilities known as balance rites<ul><li>Aim to assist the proliferation (growth, spread or increase) of a<br>particular species, which embody an individual’s ancestor spirit as they<br>existed during the Dreaming</li><li>For example, if a particular tribe was part human and part echidna in<br>the Dreaming, that tribe would have ritual responsibilities towards<br>echidnas</li></ul></li></ul><h3>Obligations to the Land and People</h3><ul><li>The Land is of Paramount importance in Aboriginal spirituality</li><li>Aboriginal people regard the Land as their mother and have worked to deepen<br>their understanding and appreciation of the Land</li><li><em>THE LAND IS INEXTRICABLY CONNECTED TO THE DREAMING</em><ul><li>The Land is the physical medium through which the Dreaming is expressed</li></ul></li><li>The Land provides the foundation for Aboriginal beliefs, traditions, rituals<br>and laws because the stories of the Dreaming are embedded in the land</li><li>The Land is the dwelling of the Ancestor Beings, and is regarded as the<br>mother of all people<ul><li>The identity of the individual is inextricably linked to the Land</li><li>Quote: “I belong to the Land, and the Land belongs to me” – Patrick<br>Dodson, 1976</li></ul></li><li>Aboriginal people are the caretakers, owners, inhabitants and custodians of<br>the Land<ul><li>This is the origin of the Acknowledgement of Country used at formal<br>events in Australia</li></ul></li><li>Aboriginal people have ritual responsibilities based on their totem</li></ul>]]></content>

The sign of the final magnitude gives the direction of the total vector.</li></ul></li></ul><h3>Steps for Adding:</h3><ol><li>Apply the sign convention to change each of the directions to signs</li><li>Add their magnitudes and their signs together</li><li>Refer to the sign convention to determine to direction of thr resultant vector</li><li>State the resultant vector</li></ol><ul><li>Example:<ul><li>A student walks 25m forward, then 16m backward, then 44m forward, then 12m backward. Determine the total displacement.</li></ul><ol><li>Forward is positive</li></ol><ul><li>25m forward = 25m</li><li>16m backward = -16m</li><li>44m forward  = 44m</li><li>12m backward = -12m</li></ul><ol start="2"><li>\(25-16+44-12 = +41\)</li><li>Positive is forward</li><li>Therefore, the total displacement is 41m forward.</li></ol></li></ul><h3>Steps for Subtracting</h3><ol><li>Apply the sign convention to change each of the directions to signs</li><li>Reverse the direction of the initial vector by reversing the sign</li><li>Do vector addition with the results</li></ol><ul><li>Example:<ul><li>An aeroplane changes course from 255m/s West to 160m/s East. Determine the change in velocity.</li></ul><ol><li>West is negative</li></ol><ul><li>225m/s West = -255m/s \(\vec{v}_1\)</li><li>160m/s East = 160m/s \(\vec{v}_2\)</li></ul><ol start="2"><li>Reverse the initial vector: \(-\vec{v}_1\) = 255m/s</li><li>Add the vectors: \(-\vec{v}_1 + \vec{v}_2 = 225+160 = 415m/s\)</li><li>Positive is east, therefore the change in velocity is 415m/s East</li></ol></li></ul><h2>Displacement, Speed and Velocity (WIP)</h2><ul><li>This section will explain the terms and concepts of RECTILINEAR (straight-line), such as position, distance, displacement, speed and velocity.</li></ul><h3>Center of Mass</h3><ul><li>An object’s motion is described in terms of their CENTER OF MASS, a single point which is the balance point of the object.</li></ul><h3>Position</h3><ul><li>Position describes the location of an object at a certain point in time with respect to the origin.</li><li>Position is a vector quantity and therefore requires a direction. The absolute reference frame for the direction is the origin of the object.</li><li>Position is measured in metres.</li></ul><h3>Distance Travelled</h3><ul><li>Distance Travelled describes how far a body travels during a journey.</li><li>Distance is a scalar quantity and is measured in meters.</li></ul>]]></content>

After the 4th shell has 2 electrons, they begin to fill from the 3rd shell until Zinc, which fills the third shell to its capacity of 18 ( $ 2,8,18,2 $ ).      - After Zinc, electrons fill the outermost shell again until Krypton ( $ 2,8,18,8 $ ), after which the fifth shell starts filling.      - This trend occurs for shells 3/4 and 4/5.</details>  - The fourth shell can hold 8 electrons until the fifth shell has 2 electrons, then another 10 (total of 18)<h3>Memorising the first 20 elements</h3><ul><li>There is an easy way to memorise the first 20 elements, the Periodic Table Song</li><li>You should memorise up to the first chorus (including the chorus) for Year 10 Chemistry. Year 11 and 12 Chemistry may require more.<br><br></li></ul><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rz4Dd1I_fX0" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe><h3>Representing Atoms</h3><ul><li>There are several ways to represent an atom.<ul><li>The first way is the atom’s symbol.</li><li>The atomic symbol is the one or two letter shortcode for the atom that can be seen on the periodic table.<br><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2e/Simple_Periodic_Table_Chart-en.svg" alt="Image of the Periodic Table"></li><li>For example, Oxygen is represented as  $ O $ , while Calcium is  $ Ca $</li><li>The first letter MUST be capital and the second letter (if present) MUST be lowercase.  $ ca $ ,  $ CA $  or  $ cA $  for Calcium are all INCORRECT answers.</li><li>Some elements have atomic symbols which somewhat match their name, such as  $ N $  for Nitrogen</li><li>Others seem completely random, such as  $ Au $  for Gold. These tend to come from their Latin names (“Aurum” in the case of Gold)</li></ul></li><li>Another way is by writing out the ELECTRON CONFIGURATION.<ul><li>This is the filling order of the electron shells.</li><li>For example, Hydrogen is  $ 1 $ , Oxygen is  $ 2,6 $ , etc.</li><li>This method is not often used for naming an element, since electron configurations can change in Chemical Reactions.</li></ul></li></ul><h2>Chemical Reactions</h2><ul><li>A chemical reaction is when the bonds between atoms are broken, formed or changed</li><li>A chemical reaction has 2 parts: reactants and products<ul><li>Reactants are the substances BEFORE the reaction</li><li>Products are the substances AFTER the reaction</li></ul></li></ul><h3>Law Of Conservation Of Mass</h3><ul><li>The Law of Conservation of Mass states that:</li></ul><blockquote>Matter cannot be created nor destroyed, it can only be changed from one form to another.</blockquote>- This means that in a chemical reaction, the total mass of the products MUST be the same as the total mass of the reactants.- For example, photosynthesis:  - 6CO2 + 6H2O —> C6H12O6 + 6O2  - On both sides of the equation, there are:    - 6 Carbon atoms    - 6 Oxygen atoms    - 12 Hydrogen atoms  - This is known as a BALANCED EQUATION### Law of Constant Proportions- The Law of Constant Proportions states that:- <blockquote>A given chemical compound always contains its components in a fixed ratio.</blockquote><ul><li>For example, in water, there will ALWAYS be two hydrogen atoms for every oxygen atom (H2O).<ul><li>If there were an equal number of hydrogen and oxygen atoms, then the substance would not be Water (H2O), instead it would be Hydrogen Peroxide (H2O2).</li></ul></li></ul><h3>Exothermic and Endothermic Reactions</h3><ul><li>An EXOTHERMIC REACTION is a reaction that GENERATES heat/energy (exo-: outside, -thermic: heat)</li><li>An ENDOTHERMIC REACTION is a reaction that REQUIRES heat/energy (endo-: inside, -thermic: heat)</li><li>Sometimes, exothermic reactions require heat to start. However, their total energy output is GREATER than the total energy input</li></ul><h3>Ionic and Covalent Bonds</h3><ul><li>An IONIC bond is a bond between oppositely charged IONS (atoms with an unequal number of protons and electrons)</li><li>Ionic bonds occur between a metal and a non-metal</li><li>One atom will LOSE electrons, and the other will GAIN electrons so that both have a filled outer shell.</li><li>For example, in  $ NaCl $ , The Sodium atom loses an electron and the Chlorine atom gains that electron. The two atoms are then electrostatically attracted together.</li><li>A COVALENT bond is a bond where two non-metal atoms SHARE a pair of valence electrons</li><li>An atom can have multiple covalent bonds. For example, carbon group atoms can have up to four covalent bonds</li><li>Noble Gases (group 18) do NOT form bonds with anything (except in rare circumstances)</li><li>Two atoms with a covalent bond can be said to be DIATOMIC</li></ul><h2>VIDEO TUTORIAL: Lewis-Dot Diagrams (&lt;8 minutes)</h2><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cIuXl7o6mAw" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe><h3>Element Groupings</h3><ul><li>The periodic table has several methods of being divided into categories.</li><li>The first method is by PERIOD<ul><li>Elements in horizontal rows are in the same period.</li><li>Each at the end of each period, the next electron shell begins to fill.</li></ul></li><li>The second method is by BLOCK<ul><li>Each block of the periodic table is determined by the electron orbitals which are filled in that block.</li><li>Each block is named after the orbital which gets filled in that block<br><img src="https://www.thoughtco.com/thmb/4QQYiqawXiYyXmWWmORUW5T_zQI=/690x391/filters:fill(auto,1)/ecblocks-56a129535f9b58b7d0bc9f2e.jpg" alt="Image of the periodic table grouped by block"></li><li>The s-block is everything in columns 1 and 2, as well as Helium</li><li>The d-block is everything from column 3 to 12, except the Lanthanides and Actinides</li><li>The p-block is everything from column 13 onwards, except Helium</li><li>The f-block is the Lanthanides and Actinides</li></ul></li><li>The third method is by GROUP<ul><li>Vertical columns of the Periodic Table are known as GROUPS</li><li>Elements in the same group have similar properties<ul><li>Group 1: Alkaline Metals</li><li>Group 2: Alkaline Earth Metals</li><li>Group 3-12: Transition Metals</li><li>Group 13: Boron Group</li><li>Group 14: Carbon Group</li><li>Group 15: Pnictogens</li><li>Group 16: Chalcogens</li><li>Group 17: Halogens</li><li>Group 18: Noble Gases</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></p><hr>Post Author: [Pranav Sharma](mailto:rbxii3@rbxii3.com)]]></content>

However, Sickle Cell Anaemia provides immunity to malaria, which may explain why it is quite common in Sub-Saharan Africa.</li></ul><p>Post Author: <a href="mailto:rbxii3@rbxii3.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pranav Sharma</a></p>]]></content>
