- As learnt in the Chemistry topic, every atom of the same element has the same number of protons (atomic number)
- However, the number of Neutrons can be different, but it will still be the same element.
- Atoms of the same element, but with different numbers of neutrons are known as ISOTOPES
- For example, Hydrogen comes in three forms:
	- Protium (normal hydrogen) with one proton and No Neutrons
    - Deuterium, which has one proton and one neutron
    - Tritium (artificially made), which has one proton and two neutrons
    - All of these are different isotopes of the same element (Hydrogen), as shown in the image below

- The symbols of isotopes are written in the form \\( \ce{^{227}_{90}Th+} \\)
