### Force
- A force can be thought of as a push or a pull
- A force that acts by being directly in contact with an object is known as a *contact force*
  - Friction and drag are both contact forces
- A force that acts on an object at a distance is called a *non-contact force* or a force mediated by a field
- The unit of force is the Newton (N)
  - 1 Newton is the force exerted when holding 100g mass against the downward pull of gravity
- If more than one force is acting on an object, the vector sum is known as the *net force*
  - \\(\vec{F}_{\text{net}} = \vec{F}_1 + \vec{F}_2 + ... \vec{F}_n\\)
- The net force for a stationary object, or one that is moving at a constant velocity, is \\(0\\), also known as *equilibrium*
- The net force for an object that is speeding up, slowing down or changing direction is \\(\neq 0\\)

## Newton's Laws of Motion
### First Law
> Every object will maintain a constant velocity unless an unbalanced external force acts on it.
- Newton's first law means that if an object has no forces acting on it, then it will continue to travel at its current speed and direction until an unbalanced net force acts on it
![Diagram of Newton's First Law](/images/kinematics-1.jpg)
- Newton's first law is closely related to the concept of *Inertia*, the tendency of an object to resist any changes in motion
- This resistance is related to the mass of the object, with more massive objects having a greater inertia
  - The result of this is that to cause the same amount of change in motion, the amount of force increases proportionally to the amount of mass. This relationship is Newton's second law
### Second Law
> \\(\vec{F}=m \vec{a}\\)
> \\(\vec{F}=Force (Newtons)\\)
> \\(m=Mass (kilograms)\\)
> \\(\vec{a}=Acceleration (m/s^2)\\)
- The acceleration of an object is directly proportional to the net force on the object, and inversely proportional to the mass of the object. Therefore:
![Newton's second law triangle](/images/newtons-second-law-triangle.png)
- \\(1N = 1kg \times m/s^2\\)
- As a result, more force on the same mass means a greater acceleration, and an equal force on less mass also means a greater acceleration
- Newton's Laws of Motions are all subject to vector addition and subtraction
### Third Law
> For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction
> \\(\vec{F}_\text{AB}=-\vec{F}\_{\text{BA}}\\)
- If object A pushes on object B with \\(x\\) Newtons of force, object B will push back on object A with \\(x\\) Newtons of force
