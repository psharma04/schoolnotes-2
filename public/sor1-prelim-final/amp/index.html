   <td>Jesus, born in Bethlehem to the Virgin Mary, sought to reform Judaism to restore the people to God&apos;s will. He challenged the material world of the Jewish people with his ministry of love and peace, leading to His Crucifixion and subsequent Resurrection.

<li>33-70 CE (Initial Wave) - begins with Pentecost after Jesus&apos; death. Disciples were filled with Holy Spirit and were commissioned by Jesus to go out into the world and &apos;make disciples of all nations&apos; (Matthew 28:19)
<ul>
<li>Peter became the leader of the Church.
</li><li>Christianity remains a sect of Judaism - adherents follow Mosaic Law and the teachings based on Hebrew Scripture, however, they celebrate the Eucharist and Baptism
</li><li>There was little formal activity in this period, as all believed that Christ&apos;s second coming was soon
</li>
</ul>
</li><li>49 CE (Council of Jerusalem) - Christians were made to abandon all pagan beliefs and follow the decalogue + Jesus&apos; teachings
<ul>
<li>Christianity was opened to the wider world, and all people could join if they renounced pagan ways and joined Christ
</li><li>The mass following this attracted was a catalyst for the separation from Judaism
</li><li>The destruction of the Jewish Temple as a result of the failed Jewish Revolt against Romans (66-73 CE) led to mass migration from citizens living in Judea
</li><li>The growing numbers of followings made formalisation of the belief imminent, which led to Christianity&apos;s split from Judaism in 100 CE
</li>
</ul>
</li><li>64-313 CE (Persecution) - The Jewish people were angered with Christianity&apos;s split and were fearful of Roman punishments if Jesus&apos; teachings continued to spread across the Roman Empire.
<ul>
<li>As a result, Christian people were persecuted by the Romans and the Jewish people. During this time, followings declined significantly
</li><li>Emperor Nero blamed the great fire of Rome (64 CE) on Christians. This signalled the beginning of the persecution, which lasted 2 centuries
</li>
</ul>
</li><li>313 CE (Edict of Milan) - Constantine granted the Edict of Milan, legalising the Christian religion within the Roman Empire and ordering the end of persecution. He issued this edict after emerging victorious out of battle after receiving a vision from God

<li>The Nicene Creed was created at the council of Nicaea (325) which signalled the official beginning of Christianity

Although God is separate from the physical world, He has a deep relationship with humanity through His love for them.
