<ul>
<li>Necessary for Jews to understand the Mishnah in an Islam-dominated world, and to understand Halachah and the Mishnah</li>
</ul>
<h3>Purpose</h3>
<ul>
<li>To assist Diaspora Jews in understanding the Written law of Judaism</li>
</ul>
<h4>Language: Arabic</h4>
<h3>Audience</h3>
<ul>
<li>Diaspora Jews and everyday Adherents</li>
</ul>
<h2>Contents</h2>

    <title>Science: Radiation</title>
    <url>/Science-Radiation/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>As learnt in the Chemistry topic, every atom of the same element has the same number of protons (atomic number)</li>
<li>However, the number of Neutrons can be different, but it will still be the same element.</li>
<li>Atoms of the same element, but with different numbers of neutrons are known as ISOTOPES</li>
<li>For example, Hydrogen comes in three forms:
<ul>
<li>Protium (normal hydrogen) with one proton and No Neutrons</li>
<li>Deuterium, which has one proton and one neutron</li>
<li>Tritium (artificially made), which has one proton and two neutrons</li>
<li>All of these are different isotopes of the same element (Hydrogen), as shown in the image below<br>
<img src="/images/forms-of-hydrogen1.png" alt="Forms of Hydrogen"></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The symbols of isotopes are written in the form \( \ce{^{M}_{A}E} \) where:
<ul>
<li>M is the mass number (number of protons + number of electrons)</li>
<li>A is the atomic number (number of protons)</li>
<li>E is the Atomic symbol (1 or 2 letter symbol of the element)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Isotopes can be unstable: the number of protons and neutrons in the nucleus of the atom is unbalanced, so the isotope is RADIOACTIVE</li>
</ul>
<h2>Radiation</h2>
<blockquote> Radiation is the emission of energy as electromagnetic waves or as moving subatomic particles, especially high-energy particles which cause ionization.
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Radiation is created when an unstable isotope emits energy in the form of Alpha, Beta or Gamma particles</li>
<li>IONIZING RADIATION is any form of radiation that has the ability to make an atom ionized (positively or negatively charged)</li>
<li>BACKGROUND RADIATION is any radiation that is present in the environment without adding any intentional sources</li>
</ul>
<h3>Types of Radiation</h3>
<ul>
<li>Alpha (α) radiation (Two protons and two neutrons bound together)
<ul>
<li>Alpha particles are created when an atom has too many protons</li>
<li>The cell emits two protons and two electrons, and the resulting atom is 2 atomic numbers lower</li>
<li>Alpha particles can be stopped by a sheet of paper, or by skin, or a few centimetres of air</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Beta (β) radiation (Single electron or single positron)
<ul>
<li>Beta particles are created when an atom has too many neutrons</li>
<li>One of the neutrons decays into one proton and one electron or positron</li>
<li>The resulting atom is one atomic number higher</li>
<li>Beta particles can be stopped by a sheet of aluminum, or 100cm of air</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Gamma (γ) radiation (high energy electromagnetic wave)
<ul>
<li>Gamma radiation is created when an atom needs to lose excess energy</li>
<li>The atom releases a high-energy photon known as a GAMMA RAY</li>
<li>The atom’s atomic number and mass do not change</li>
<li>Gamma Rays can be stopped by 100m thick concrete, or 40cm of lead</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Neutron (n) radiation (Single neutron)
<ul>
<li>Neutron radiation is created as a product of nuclear fusion or fission, where the product(s) does not require the extra neutron</li>
<li>The reaction releases a neutron (or multiple neutrons)</li>
<li>Neutron radiation is a byproduct of nuclear reactions, so the change in atomic mass and number depends on the reaction. However, the total mass of the resulting atom(s) is one less than the total mass of the reactant(s)</li>
<li>Neutron radiation can be stopped by boron, hydrocarbons, water, or large blocks of concrete</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

    <title>SOR1: Religion And Beliefs in Australia post-1945</title>
    <url>/sor1-hsc-consolidation-1/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<h2>Contemporary Aboriginal Spirituality</h2>
<h3>Aboriginal Spirituality as Determined by the Dreaming</h3>
<p><strong>Discuss how Aboriginal spirituality is determined by the Dreaming</strong></p>
<p><em>Kinship</em></p>
<ul>
<li>The Dreaming – underpins all aspects of Aboriginal spirituality and traditional life</li>
<li>Kinship – fabric of traditional Aboriginal society – everyone is related through the complex web of the Dreaming</li>
<li>Totems:
<ul>
<li>Tribes are made up of clans, each descended from a spirit ancestor</li>
<li>Totem – a natural part of the region the clan originated from</li>
<li>Represents the ongoing life force of the Dreaming – are used at ceremonies</li>
<li>Unifies the clan under the spirit ancestor and creates a metaphysical connection with other clans bearing the same totem</li>
<li>Transcendent bond between humans and their totem as well as a Dreaming kinship with other individuals bearing the same totem</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Spirit ancestors:
<ul>
<li>Expect the members of these kinship groups to fulfil certain obligations</li>
<li>Required to obey tribal laws and beliefs and to subordinate individual interests to the greater good of the community</li>
<li>Reciprocal network of giving and receiving of right and obligations</li>
<li>Expect the knowledge will be passed down through the tribe</li>
<li>Require the kinship group to act as custodians of designated territory and totems</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Ceremonial life</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Aboriginal ceremonies always reaffirm the Dreaming</li>
<li>Vital – event happened in the past – also believed to be happening in the present</li>
<li>Usually recreate a moment of the Dreaming – allow participants to spiritually transform</li>
<li>Obliged to take part – acknowledge the Dreaming events and show the ongoing metaphysical presence of the parallel Dreaming world</li>
<li>Connected to spirituality as it is the expression of spirituality</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Obligations to the land and people</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Land, people and Dreaming- one symbiotic relationship –cannot exist without each other</li>
<li>Comprise a complex system of reciprocal obligations and rights – contribute to the ongoing physical and spiritual wellbeing of each other</li>
<li>Sacred duty to assist the land in ‘living’ to its potential – performance of ceremonies and rituals</li>
<li>The land has certain obligations – provides the necessary tools for performing ceremonies e.g. body decorations derived from the natural landscape</li>
<li>Inseparable and timeless connection with land – often regard land as mother</li>
</ul>
<h3>Issues for Aboriginal Spiritualties in Relation to: the effect of dispossession and the Land Rights movement</h3>
<p><strong>Discuss the continuing effect of dispossession on Aboriginal spiritualities in relation to:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Only make up 7.2% of Aus. population</li>
<li>Lower life expectancy – males- 67, females- 72</li>
<li>Higher incarceration rates – 20% prison population</li>
<li>High unemployment rates – 20% of indigenous population</li>
<li>5x avg. in drug induced mental disorders</li>
<li>2x avg. schizophrenia</li>
<li>2-3x avg. suicide</li>
<li>Higher rates of homelessness – 9% of indigenous population</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Separation from the land</em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Terra Nullius</em> – forced dispossession of Aboriginal people from the land</li>
<li>Squatters denied access to waterholes, hunting grounds and sacred sites</li>
<li>Private property \(\rightarrow\) illegal to enter own ancestral territory – shot for doing so</li>
<li>Imported stock e.g. cows trampled the earth and muddied water holes, introduction of pests e.g. rabbits damaged the sacred landscape</li>
<li>Separation from Dreaming lands \(\rightarrow\) lost spirituality and totemic identity</li>
<li>Spiritual despair \(\rightarrow\) slow self destruction still existing today</li>
<li>Populations died out or dramatically declined- disease, malnutrition, alcohol dependence</li>
<li>Managing to live in a manner that closely resembles the traditional ways</li>
<li>Managing to integrate some traditional beliefs into more European way of life</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Separation from kinship groups</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Impossible to detach individuals from the wider community or the Dreaming family</li>
<li>Dispossession of people from land \(\rightarrow\) breakdown of the kinship system- isolated from ancestral territory and knowledge that had unified groups</li>
<li>Forced to forfeit their places of totemic identity and extended spiritual family</li>
<li>Decline of indigenous language – 350-750 distinct dialects \(\rightarrow\) less than 150</li>
<li>Many Dreaming stories and myths have died out</li>
<li>Dispassion of land and kinship groups \(\rightarrow\) breakdown in the authority of elders- rapidly hastening the separation of kinship groups</li>
<li>Without access to dreaming kin – lost ability to fulfil spiritual obligations =</li>
<li>Could no longer unite with Dreaming family in ceremonies and rites</li>
</ul>
<p><em>The Stolen Generations</em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Protection and Assimilation Act</em> – Aboriginal children were forcibly removed from families</li>
<li>Stated was for children’s welfare – attempt to ‘breed out’ Indigenous people</li>
<li>Families were cut off from each other – taken great distances away, had names changed, backgrounds erased</li>
<li>Cultural genocide</li>
<li>Devastating for Aboriginal spirituality and the psyche of those involved</li>
<li>3x higher infant mortality</li>
<li>3x more likely to suffer lifestyle diseases</li>
<li>6x higher unemployment rates</li>
<li>Over representation in correctional facilities</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Outline the important of the following for the Land Rights movement:</strong></p>
<p><em>Native Title</em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Terra Nullius</em> extinguished Native Title Acts under state and federal laws</li>
<li>NT recognises the rights of Indigenous peoples in relation to the areas of land and water belonging to their particular ancestral tribes and the validity of Aboriginal territorial laws already existing prior to European settlement</li>
<li>While not giving actual land ownership title to Indigenous peoples it allows some access to ancestral lands</li>
<li>Facilitates use of land for spiritual and ceremonial etc</li>
<li>Woodward Royal Commission – first gov’t inquiry to appreciate the crucial link between Aboriginal spirituality and the land</li>
<li><em>Racial Discrimination Act 1975</em> –minority racial groups entitled to the same privileges and rights</li>
<li><em>Aboriginal Land Rights Act 1976</em> – endorsed limited recognition of Indigenous people’s rights to the land</li>
<li><em>Native Title Act</em> gave official recognition to the Indigenous way of life, particularly its spiritual connection with the land prior to European settlement</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Mabo</em></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>1982</strong>: Mabo and a group of others took QLD gov’t to court, wanting legal recognition of their land as their families had lived there since ‘time immemorial’</li>
<li>The deep spiritual significance was emphasised by the fact that Mabo repeatedly quoted stories and morals associated with his ancestral deity ‘Malo the Law Giver’</li>
<li>Lost in the Supreme Court, took it to the High Court and Federal Parliament passed the <em>Native Title Act</em></li>
</ul>
<p><em>Wik</em></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>1996</strong>: The Wik people of Cape York brought a case to the High Court arguing their right to Native Title on local pastoral land</li>
<li>High Court ruled in their favour and decided that Native Title rights and the rights of pastoral leaseholders could exist simultaneously</li>
<li><strong>1998</strong>: <em>Native Title Amendment Act</em> – increased the power of the state gov’t over Native Title claims, reducing the rights of Aboriginals to negotiate directly with pastoral leaseholders</li>
<li><strong>2006</strong>: <em>Native Title Amendment Act</em> – aims to make the Native Title process ‘more efficient’ and to hasten the processing of the active claims that are awaiting determination</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Analyse the importance of the Dreaming for the Land Rights movement</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Despite over 70% of Indigenous Australians claiming adherence to Christianity- has not diminished sense of ‘country’ and Dreaming connection to land</li>
<li>Restored access to ancestral land that enabled the Dreaming to become dynamic reality once again</li>
<li>Existence of Dreaming site and the possession of Dreaming knowledge forms the basis of Land Rights claims under the Land Rights and Native Title laws</li>
<li>Demonstration of an ongoing affiliation with the land necessary for proof of entitlement – stories, songs, dances and sacred objects</li>
<li>Difficulties with secret Dreaming sites – reluctant to reveal whereabouts to invasive scrutiny of the courts</li>
<li>Issue – much of the evidence is based on oral tradition – can be dismissed as simple folklore or considered non objective and unreliable</li>
<li>Dreaming legends may have adapted to incorporate Christian motifs and experiences</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Account for the present religious landscape in Australia in relation to:</strong></p>
<p><em>Christianity as the major religious religious tradition</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Christianity has been and still is the major religion in Australia</li>
<li>Post WWII, Australia counted 88% of its population as Christian</li>
<li>Today, 64% of Australian identify as Christian</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Immigration</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Post 1945, the Christian face of Australian society changed dramatically due to the immigration of people fleeing Europe</li>
<li>Migrant – huge boost to numbers of Roman Catholics and Eastern Orthodox adherents in Aus.</li>
<li>Roman Catholicism boosted almost 6% between 1947 and 1966</li>
<li>Eastern Orthodox rose from 0.2% to 3% between 1947 and 1981 – large influx of Greek immigrants</li>
<li>Small influx of Jews – reflected as 0.3% to 0.5% between 1933 to 1966</li>
<li>More recent waves of Jewish migration to Aus. – almost 17% of Jewish population arrived after 1980</li>
<li>1976 – Islam became present in Aus. 0.3%</li>
<li>Between 1966 and 2006 Islamic population risen 69.4% due to immigration from Bosnia, Somalia and Ethiopia</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Denominational switching</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Many people are no longer making life long commitments to one church – more likely to go wherever they feel comfortable and well catered for</li>
<li>Within Christian denominations – dramatic swing away from more liberal churches towards more conservative churches</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Rise of New Age religions</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Among the fastest growing faiths in the 2011 census increasing by 140% since 1996</li>
<li>Differ from traditional faiths in that, while they form an overall spiritual movement they lack any unifying creed or doctrine</li>
<li>Regardless, adherents tend to share some similar beliefs and practices</li>
<li>Why?
<ul>
<li>A reaction against what is seen as a failure of Christianity and other mainstream religions to satisfactorily respond to the needs of people today</li>
<li>Concept of something well tried and yet new and different in important</li>
<li>Spread out due to the support of celebrities</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Secularism</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Any movement or concept, which rejects religious belief or adherence</li>
<li><strong>1971</strong>: ‘No Religion’ category included on census – explains rapid increase at the time</li>
<li>Secular systems based on reason, fact and scientific analysis and therefore, differ from religious systems, which tend to be based on divine revelation and spiritual insight</li>
<li>However, today there is less emphasis on conforming and more emphasis on the autonomy of the individual to determine what feels spiritually right to them</li>
<li>Increased freedom – rise of secularism and the understanding that religion is essentially a private concern</li>
</ul>
<h3>Religious Dialogue in Multi-Faith Australia: ecumenical movements within Christianity, interfaith dialogue, the relationship between Aboriginal spiritualities and religious traditions in the process of Reconciliation</h3>
<p><strong>Describe the impact of Christian ecumenical movements in Australia</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Ecumenism refers to the movement towards religious unity among Christian denominations</li>
<li>Acknowledgement that unity in Christ outweighs the diversity in practice and beliefs in Christianity</li>
<li>Developing opportunities to work, worship and dialogue together</li>
</ul>
<p>The National Council of Churches Australia (NCCA)</p>
<ul>
<li>Formed 1994</li>
<li>Grew from the previous Australian Council of Churches</li>
<li>Comprised of 19 member churches representing the Catholic, Anglican, Orthodox and Protestant expressions of Christianity</li>
<li>Works in partnership with state ecumenical councils and it operates through various commissions each which deals with a specific sphere of influence</li>
<li>Faith and unity: week of prayer for Christian Unity</li>
<li>Social justice network: annual social justice statements on pressing issues i.e. environment, peace, prisons etc</li>
</ul>
<p>NSW Ecumenical Council</p>
<ul>
<li>Fellowship of 14 Protestant and Orthodox churches in NSW and ACT</li>
<li>Maintaining “the unity of the Spirit in the bonds of peace” Ephesians 4:3</li>
<li>Being committed to the Gospel</li>
<li>Proclaiming it together, and living out the implications of the Gospel for service in the world</li>
<li>Taize Pilgrimage:
<ul>
<li>Hosted visits fro a brother from the Taize Community in France, as part of our churches’ common commitment to a spirituality of peace and reconciliation</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Peace and Justice Commission:
<ul>
<li>Works to enhance outcomes for asylum seekers \</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Evaluate the important of interfaith dialogue in multi-faith Australia</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Formal discussion aimed towards developing greater mutual understanding between different religious traditions</li>
<li>Allowing different religions to come to a better appreciation of the uniqueness of each other</li>
<li>Education to dispel fear and bigotry</li>
<li>Seeking opportunities to work together on key issues i.e. asylum seekers</li>
<li>Allows religions to come to a better understanding of each other which increases tolerance e.g. education programs run of the ACCJ and State Bodies, Interfaith Iftar 2012 by Affinity Intercultural</li>
<li>Promotes religion as having an important role, even in our increasingly secular Australian society</li>
<li>Promotes shared prayer and spirituality in times of crisis i.e. the Port Arthur Massacre or the Bali Bombings</li>
<li>Creates respect and appreciation for religious diversity which is essential for harmony and peace</li>
<li>Has worked to break down the stereotypes and prejudice towards Muslims which has been overtly prevalent in Australia since 9/11 and the Cronulla Riots</li>
<li>Can build relationships between different religions so they can more often and more effectively speak out on common issues and uphold shared values i.e. the dignity of the person, the sanctity of human life, care for those in need, justice and peace</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Examine the relationship between Aboriginal spiritualities and religious traditions in the process of Reconciliation</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Christian churches are now actively involved in promoting Aboriginal reconciliation, both at an individual and an ecumenical level</li>
<li>Catholic Church is a strong supporter of Aboriginal reconciliation</li>
<li>Church leaders have committed the Catholic community to addressing the injustice and disadvantage facing Aboriginal people</li>
<li>Actively work in an advocacy role to dismantle or reform social structures, processes and institutions, which are a source of injustice and disadvantage to the Aboriginal community</li>
<li>Position of the Anglican Church on Aboriginal reconciliation to similar to that of the Catholic Church – recognise the importance of Aboriginal spirituality</li>
<li>1988: Anglican Church officially apologised for the hurt inflicted upon Aboriginal people and ten years later the General Synod formally apologised to the Stolen Generations</li>
<li>Christian Churches work together to collectively assist the Aboriginal community to reclaim its spirituality</li>
<li>Examples:
<ul>
<li><strong>National Reconciliation Week</strong>: aims to give people across Australia, of all religions, the opportunity to focus on reconciliation</li>
<li><strong>Corroboree 2000</strong>: hundred of thousands of people from across Australia joined to walk for reconciliation across the Sydney Harbour Bridge</li>
</ul>
</li>

    <title>SOR1: Changing Patterns of Religious Adherence in Australia</title>
    <url>/SOR1-Changing-Religious-Adherence/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<h2>Christianity as the Major Religious Tradition</h2>
<ul>
<li>Since 1947, the patterns of religious adherence have been steadily changing, as shown in the Australian census</li>
<li>The First Fleet established Christianity (specifically Anglicanism and, to some extent, Catholicism) in Australia in 1788</li>
<li>As a result, most of the laws of Australia are based in Christian ethics and teachings</li>
<li>The White Australia policy meant that most migrants were from Europe, which is predominantly Christian
<ul>
<li>Anglicanism is mostly common in England, while the rest of Western Europe tends to be Catholic</li>
<li>As a result, the balance of Christian denominations in Australia shifted towards a predominantly Catholic community</li>
<li>Some Orthodox Christians also came to Australia due to political instability in Eastern Europe</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The percentage of Christian adherents has decreased since 1947, steadily falling.</li>
<li>1961 - 88.4%</li>
<li>1986 - 74.1%</li>
<li>2016 - 52%<br>
<img src="https://csec-cdn.intranet.pw/schoolnotes.intranet.pw/christianity-census.png" alt="Christian Denomination Census Breakdown"></li>
<li>The fall in Christian adherence is attributed to an increase in people turning away from religion, as well as migration from Asia and the Middle East</li>
</ul>
<h3>Formation of the Uniting Church</h3>
<ul>
<li>The Uniting Church was formed as a result of the decline of adherents for three Christian denominations
<ul>
<li>Presbytarians</li>
<li>Methodists</li>
<li>Congregationalists</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Peaked in 1986 at 7.6% of Australians</li>
<li>Due to an older adherent base, Uniting Church adherence has declined in recent years</li>
</ul>
<h2>Rise of New-Age Religions</h2>
<ul>
<li>New-Age religions are a group of spiritual practices/beliefs developed in Western society from the 1970s and onwards</li>
<li>New-Age Religions tend to be ECLECTIC (ideas/beliefs which come from a wide range of sources)
<ul>
<li>Eclectic religions take elements from other religions, as well as philosophies, sciences and other sources in order to create a system which they believe is better suited to their community</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Formed as a reaction against the percieved failure of traditional religious (such as Christianity), and the failure of Secular Humanism to provide spiritual and ethical guidance for the future
<ul>
<li>Secular Humanism: a philosophy or life stance that embraces human reason, non-religious ethics, and philosophical naturalism while specifically rejecting religious dogma, supernaturalism, and superstition as the basis of morality and decision making.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Beliefs of New Age religions include:
<ul>
<li>Monism: All that exists is derived from a single source of divine energy</li>
<li>Pantheism: God is everything that exists, God is at once the entire universe, and transcends the universe as well</li>
<li>Reincarnation: After death, we are reborn and live another life as a human. This cycle repeats itself many times</li>
<li>Karma: The good and bad deeds that we do adds and subtracts from our accumulated record, our karma.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>New Age Practices include:</li>
<li>Channeling: A method similar to that used by Spiritists in which a spirit of a long dead individual is conjured up.has existed since the 1850’s and many groups consider themselves independent of the New Age movement.</li>
<li>Crystals: Crystals are materials big rocks which has its molecules arranged in a specific, highly ordered internal pattern.</li>
<li>Meditating: A process of blanking out the mind and releasing oneself from conscious thinking.</li>
<li>New Age Music: A gentle, melodic, inspirational music form involving the human voice, harp, lute, flute, etc. It is used as an aid in healing, massage therapy and general relaxation.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Secularism</h2>
<ul>
<li>The belief that religion should not interfere with public affairs</li>
<li>Caused by changing social standards, resulting in the decrease in percieved relevance of religious traditions</li>
<li>Rise of pluralism (differing political standpoints within society), materialism and individualism</li>
<li>Most evident through the increase of “No Religion” in the Census</li>
</ul>
<h2>Immigration</h2>
<ul>
<li>Immigration has caused a major shift for religion in Australia since 1947</li>
<li>The first wave of immigration after World War 2 resulted in the establishment of a Jewish population in Australia, as well as an increase in Orthodox and Catholic people, but a decrease in Anglicanism</li>
<li>The second wave of immigration came from Asia and the Middle East
<ul>
<li>Stemmed from a fear of communism, as well as wars such as the Vietnam War, Cambodian Civil War, etc.</li>
<li>Saw an increase in Islam and the establishment of Buddhism</li>
<li>Decrease in Anglicanism</li>
<li>Formation of the Uniting Church</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The third wave of immigration is a result of war, famine and terrorism
<ul>
<li>Caused by events such as the Gaza War, rise of Al Qaeda and Islamic State</li>
<li>Increase in Hinduism, Islam and Buddhism</li>
<li>Total drop of over 30% in Christianity</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<li>Protestants are most likely to switch denominations because they believe that the Bible is subjective, and are therefore able to interpret the nature of passages in their own way
<ul>
<li>Because of this, they can switch to a denomination that better suits their beliefs</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Catholics and Orthodox Christians are less likely to switch because they are more static in their beliefs
<ul>
<li>The Bible is considered a complete, objective and unchanging document and therefore they have not changed over the last 1500 years</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>10% of all people who took part in the survey changed denominations in the past five years (between 2010 and 2015)
<ul>
<li>This increased to 17% when only surveying Protestants</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Pentecostalism is the fastest growing denomination (220000 in 2006 to 260500 in 2016)</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>People no longer remain in a particular denomination simply because their parents and grandparents belonged to it or because they share the same ethnic background with other church members. </blockquote>

    <title>Physics: Newton's Laws of Motion</title>
    <url>/newtons-laws/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<h2>First Law: Inertia</h2>
<blockquote>An object in motion will stay in motion, and will maintain its speed and direction, unless acted on by an unbalanced force</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>The principle of INERTIA is that all objects have a tendency to resist change in motion.</li>
<li>An object with all forces balanced out will not change speed or direction until another force is applied to it.
<ul>
<li>For example, a person sitting on a chair is being pulled down by gravity, but pushed up with an equal NORMAL FORCE. The person does not change speed or direction.</li>
<li>If the person in the above example is in a moving car, which suddenly brakes, the person will continue to move forward until they are stopped by the seat in front of them: the person resists any change in motion until acted on by an external force (the seat in front)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A more massive object therefore needs more force to reach the same acceleration as a less massive object.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Second Law</h2>
<blockquote>Force is equal to mass times acceleration</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>This is expressed mathematically as \(F=ma\)
<ul>
<li>F: Force in Newtons (N)</li>
<li>m: Mass in Kilograms (kg)</li>
<li>a: Acceleration in Meters per Second squared \(m/s^2\)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Third Law</h2>
<blockquote>Every Action has an Equal but Opposite Reaction</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>The reaction force is known as the NORMAL FORCE</li>
<li>The Normal force always acts perpendicular (at \(90^\circ\)) to the surface that your object is on</li>
<li>The Normal force changes magnitude based on the force that it is attempting to balance</li>
</ul>

    <title>SOR1: Dispossession</title>
    <url>/sor1-dispossession/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<h2>Separation from the Land</h2>
<ul>
<li>For Aboriginal people, loss of Land is the same as loss of spiritual identity
<ul>
<li>Results in inability to fulfill ritual responsibilities, and a loss of purpose</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Land is inextricably connected to kinship, ceremonial life, family connections and relationships</li>
<li>Loss of land resulted in the destruction of totemic responsibilities</li>
</ul>
<h3>Order of events</h3>
<ul>
<li>1788: settlement and establishment of Terra Nullius, marked the start of the removal of tribes from the Land</li>
<li>1820s-1850s: government and churches established missions and reserves</li>
<li>Imposed Chrisitianity and European culture/lifestyle</li>
<li>Objected to most aspects of Aboriginal spirituality</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://csec-cdn.intranet.pw/schoolnotes.intranet.pw/flowchart-dispossession.png" alt="Flowchart of the effects of dispossession"></p>
<h2>Separation from Kinship Groups</h2>
<ul>
<li>Destroyed kinship and the identity of Aboriginal communities</li>
<li>Wiped out thousands of years of stories and culture, which is irretrievable without those kinship ties</li>
</ul>
<h3>Order of events</h3>
<ul>
<li>1838: Policy of Protection forcibly placed Aboriginal people on missions and reserves, which resulted in the mass dispossession of Aboriginal people
<ul>
<li>Deliberate attempt to destroy Aboriginal spirituality</li>
<li>Resulted in the destruction of kinship, traditional gender roles, culture, language, etc.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>1901: Policy of Assimilation removed mixed Aboriginal people from kinship groups
<ul>
<li>Assimilated mixed children were not permitted to visit Aboriginal relatives, which was detrimental to the all-encompassing nature of Aboriginal spirituality</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Stolen Generations</h2>
<ul>
<li>From the late 1800s to the 1970s, forced separation of Aboriginal children from their families was Government policy</li>
<li>As many as 100000 children were removed in a deliberate attempt to remove their Aboriginal identity and deteriorate the Aboriginal culture</li>
<li>Bringing Them Home Report:</li>
<li>Revealed the loss of Heritage, Culture, Language, Land and Community</li>
<li>Made 54 recommendations to the government, e.g. 7a, which recommended for a National Sorry Day to be held annually</li>
<li>Life expectancy: Aboriginal life expectancy is 20 years below the Australian average</li>
<li>Indicative of a poor, subordinate class in Australian society</li>
<li>Caused by the loss of land and disconnection with family and kinship groups</li>
</ul>

    <title>SOR1: Aboriginal Spirituality As Determined By The Dreaming</title>
    <url>/aboriginal-spirituality-dreaming/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>The Dreaming is a fundamental concept that underpins all aspects of<br>
Aboriginal spirituality</li>
<li>The Dreaming refers to Aboriginal spiritual beliefs about creation and<br>
existence</li>
<li>According to Aboriginal spirituality, all life is part of a larger network<br>
that can be traced back to the ANCESTOR BEINGS of the Dreaming</li>
<li>The Dreaming involves all knowledge and understanding in Aboriginal<br>
societies</li>
<li>The Dreaming incorporates an explanation for the origins of the Universe</li>
<li><em>The Dreaming is INEXTRICABLY CONNECTED TO THE LAND</em> as the Land is the<br>
physical medium through which the Dreaming is expressed, and since the<br>
Ancestor Spirits are said to continue to reside within the Land</li>
<li>The Dreaming is METATEMPORAL, meaning it incorporates the past, present and<br>
future as a complete and present reality</li>
<li>The Dreaming is embedded in all aspects of Aboriginal life, because every<br>
part of Aboriginal life is derived from the Dreaming</li>
</ul>
<h3>Kinship</h3>
<ul>
<li>Kinship identify a system of belonging and responsibilities within a clan</li>
<li>Kinship is not only based on family, but also one’s totem, usually a plant<br>
or an animal, which represent a person’s or group’s connection with the<br>
Ancestor Spirits</li>
<li>Kinship ties govern all interactions with other people (such as who you can<br>
marry, who you can talk to, etc.), as well as responsibilities (such as<br>
educating younger generations, etc.)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Art</h3>
<ul>
<li>Art is a very important method of communicating the Dreaming because it<br>
illustrates the actions of the Ancestor Spirits in the Land</li>
<li>Aboriginal art has multiple layers of meaning:
<ul>
<li>At face value, they are merely a depiction of the land, similar to a map<br>
or cartography chart</li>
<li>At a deeper level, they portray the actions of the Ancestor Spirits</li>
<li>To the initiated, more subtle, profound meanings are visible, further<br>
educating them on the actions of the Ancestor Spirits</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Stories</h3>
<ul>
<li>Stories from the Dreaming describe Aboriginal Law and Lifestyle</li>
<li>The Dreaming is often described through stories which dictate the Ancestor<br>
Spirits moved through the land, creating features that are visible today</li>
<li>These stories provide a foundation and explanation of various aspects of<br>
Aboriginal tradition and law by explaining the creation of the Natural World<br>
and how the Dreaming shapes the day-to-day life of people and animals</li>
<li>Learning the Dreaming stories is a lifelong process, and is important for<br>
teaching Aboriginal people the moral conduct of their people and of society</li>
</ul>
<h3>Rituals</h3>
<ul>
<li>Rituals from the Dreaming relive the actions of the Ancestor Spirits</li>
<li>Derived from important aspects of the Dreaming</li>
<li>Important because they are understood as reliving an event in the present<br>
moment</li>
<li>Ancestor Beings are “made present” through the people, objects, words, and<br>
movements used during the ritual
<ul>
<li>Example: The Smoking Ceremony, in which smoke is used to cleanse and<br>
heal. The ritual is performed symbolically at public events, but also<br>
during other traditional uses such as smoking ceremonies</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Totems carry ceremonial responsibilities known as balance rites
<ul>
<li>Aim to assist the proliferation (growth, spread or increase) of a<br>
particular species, which embody an individual’s ancestor spirit as they<br>
existed during the Dreaming</li>
<li>For example, if a particular tribe was part human and part echidna in<br>
the Dreaming, that tribe would have ritual responsibilities towards<br>
echidnas</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Obligations to the Land and People</h3>
<ul>
<li>The Land is of Paramount importance in Aboriginal spirituality</li>
<li>Aboriginal people regard the Land as their mother and have worked to deepen<br>
their understanding and appreciation of the Land</li>
<li><em>THE LAND IS INEXTRICABLY CONNECTED TO THE DREAMING</em>
<ul>
<li>The Land is the physical medium through which the Dreaming is expressed</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The Land provides the foundation for Aboriginal beliefs, traditions, rituals<br>
and laws because the stories of the Dreaming are embedded in the land</li>
<li>The Land is the dwelling of the Ancestor Beings, and is regarded as the<br>
mother of all people
<ul>
<li>The identity of the individual is inextricably linked to the Land</li>
<li>Quote: “I belong to the Land, and the Land belongs to me” – Patrick<br>
Dodson, 1976</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Aboriginal people are the caretakers, owners, inhabitants and custodians of<br>
the Land
<ul>
<li>This is the origin of the Acknowledgement of Country used at formal<br>
events in Australia</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Aboriginal people have ritual responsibilities based on their totem</li>
</ul>

    <title>Physics Preliminary Module 1: Kinematics</title>
    <url>/kinematics/</url>

  src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/mathjax@3/es5/tex-mml-chtml.js">
</script>
<h2>Motion</h2>
<ul>
<li>Motion is a fundamental observable phenomenon.</li>
<li>The study of Kinematics involves describing, measuring, and analysing motion without considering the forces and masses involved.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Scalars and Vectors</h2>
<ul>
<li>Scalars are physical quantities that can be described as a magnitude, with a unit (for example, 60km/h)
<ul>
<li>Examples of Scalars include time, distance, volume, and speed</li>
<li>Scalars are represented by a simple italic symbol, such as <em>t</em> for time or <em>d</em> for distance</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Vectors are physical quantities that can be described as a magnitude, a unit and a direction (for example, 20m West)
<ul>
<li>Examples of Vectors include position, displacement, velocity, acceleration, and force</li>
<li>Vectors are represented using VECTOR NOTATION.
<ul>
<li>The most common type of vector notation uses an arrow above the symbol, for example \(\vec{v}\) for Velocity</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Adding and Subtracting Vectors Using Algebra (One Dimension)</h2>
<ul>
<li>When adding or subtracting vectors using algebra, a sign convention must be established to represent the direction
<ul>
<li>For example, positive for forwards and negative for backwards</li>
<li>When using a sign convention it is CRUCIAL to provide a key explaining the convention used.</li>
<li>Using a sign convention allows you to enter the directions and magnitudes into your calculator. The sign of the final magnitude gives the direction of the total vector.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Steps for Adding:</h3>
<ol>
<li>Apply the sign convention to change each of the directions to signs</li>
<li>Add their magnitudes and their signs together</li>
<li>Refer to the sign convention to determine to direction of thr resultant vector</li>
<li>State the resultant vector</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Example:
<ul>
<li>A student walks 25m forward, then 16m backward, then 44m forward, then 12m backward. Determine the total displacement.</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>Forward is positive</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>25m forward = 25m</li>
<li>16m backward = -16m</li>
<li>44m forward  = 44m</li>
<li>12m backward = -12m</li>
</ul>
<ol start="2">
<li>\(25-16+44-12 = +41\)</li>
<li>Positive is forward</li>
<li>Therefore, the total displacement is 41m forward.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Steps for Subtracting</h3>
<ol>
<li>Apply the sign convention to change each of the directions to signs</li>
<li>Reverse the direction of the initial vector by reversing the sign</li>
<li>Do vector addition with the results</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Example:
<ul>
<li>An aeroplane changes course from 255m/s West to 160m/s East. Determine the change in velocity.</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>West is negative</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>225m/s West = -255m/s \(\vec{v}_1\)</li>
<li>160m/s East = 160m/s \(\vec{v}_2\)</li>
</ul>
<ol start="2">
<li>Reverse the initial vector: \(-\vec{v}_1\) = 255m/s</li>
<li>Add the vectors: \(-\vec{v}_1 + \vec{v}_2 = 225+160 = 415m/s\)</li>
<li>Positive is east, therefore the change in velocity is 415m/s East</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Displacement, Speed and Velocity</h2>
<ul>
<li>This section will explain the terms and concepts of RECTILINEAR (straight-line), such as position, distance, displacement, speed and velocity.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Center of Mass</h3>
<ul>
<li>An object’s motion is described in terms of their CENTER OF MASS, a single point which is the balance point of the object.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Position</h3>
<ul>
<li>Position describes the location of an object at a certain point in time with respect to the origin.</li>
<li>Position is a vector quantity and therefore requires a direction. The absolute reference frame for the direction is the origin of the object.</li>
<li>Position is measured in metres.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Distance Travelled</h3>
<ul>
<li>Distance Travelled describes how far a body travels during a journey.</li>
<li>Distance is a scalar quantity and is measured in meters.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Displacement-Time Graphs</h2>
<ul>
<li>Displacement-time graphs can be used to summarise the motion of an object</li>
<li>The gradient of the graph at any point is the velocity at that point<br>

<h2>Fossils</h2>
<ul>
<li>A fossil is evidence of past life.</li>
<li>Fossils can be part of an organism, such as its bones, teeth, feathers, scales, branches or leaves.</li>
<li>Fossils can also be traces, such as footprints, burrows and other evidence that an organism existed in an area.</li>
<li>Fossils provide evidence that life has changed over time. Some life forms that used to exist on Earth no longer exist.</li>
<li>Studying the fossil record also provides evidence that life forms have become more complex over time.</li>
<li>The study of fossils is called Palaeontology.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Major Milestones in the History of Life</h2>
<ul>
<li>Ice Ages</li>
<li>Cambrian Explosion</li>
<li>Photosynthesis</li>
<li>Merger between mitochondria and anaerobic organisms</li>
<li>Formation of the KT Boundary (Extinction of the dinosaurs)</li>
<li>Motion of tectonic plates</li>
<li>Land animals developing eggs</li>
<li>Animals moving onto Land</li>
</ul>
<h2>Formation of life on Earth</h2>
<ol>
<li>Planet Earth forms</li>
<li>Core and Crust forms</li>
<li>First Oceans</li>
<li>First Life (Cyanobacteria or Archea)</li>
<li>Oxygen accumulates in the atmosphere</li>

<li>First Vertebrates (Fish)</li>
<li>First land plants</li>
<li>Dinosaurs</li>
<li>Dinosaurs go Extinct</li>
<li>Humans</li>
</ol>
<h2>Theory of evolution</h2>
<ul>
<li>All life on Earth shares a common ancestor.</li>
<li>All the different species on Earth underwent mutations in the past to better suit their environment.</li>
<li>Evolution (Not Theory of Evolution) means “descent with modification”</li>
<li>Darwin’s Theory of Evolution states that all life shares a common ancestor, and that the differences between life forms is explained by Survival of the Fittest</li>
</ul>
<h2>Natural Selection</h2>
<ul>
<li>Natural selection is the concept of survival of the fittest.</li>
<li>There are 4 conditions for natural selections: variation between individuals, heredity, reproduction and variation of fitness</li>
<li>Selective pressures are phenomena that impact on an organism’s fitness</li>
</ul>
<h3>Stages of Natural Selection</h3>
<h4>1. Isolation</h4>
<ul>
<li>A species becomes separated by an environmental factor e.g. formation of a river</li>
</ul>
<h4>2. Variation</h4>
<ul>
<li>A mutation occurs in one of the isolated groups</li>
</ul>
<h4>3. Selection</h4>
<ul>
<li>If the mutation improves fitness, the mutation is passed on to the next generation</li>
</ul>
<h4>4. Speciation</h4>
<ul>
<li>After several generations, the isolated group has a majority of individuals carrying the mutation, and these individuals are considered to have evolved.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Law of Superposition</h2>
<ul>
<li>Because upper layers are younger than the ones beneath them, the law of superposition states that a fossil’s age can be determined by the age of fossils around them. This only applies to UNDISTURBED rock.</li>
<li>Relative age: age of the fossil based on the Law of Superposition, e.g. Fossil A is older than Fossil B but younger than fossil C.</li>
<li>Absolute age: the actual age of the fossil, e.g. Fossil A is 6000 years old.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Analysing the Fossil record</h2>
<ul>
<li>Faulting can cause projections of rock through other layers.</li>
<li>Folding results in layers of rock being moved away from each other.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Why are fossils important?</h2>
<ul>
<li>Fossils allow us to determine early biodiversity</li>
<li>Fossils can be compared to modern day organisms</li>
<li>Fossils improve our understanding of previous conditions on Earth</li>
<li>Fossils support our estimates for the age of the Earth</li>
<li>Fossils provide evidence for Evolution</li>
<li>Fossils provide evidence of continental drift</li>
</ul>
<h2>Mitosis</h2>
<ul>
<li>Mitosis is the process by which one parent cell splits into two identical daughter cells.</li>
<li>Mitosis is the most common method of reproduction for single-celled organisms.</li>
<li>There are 5 main stages of mitosis:</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>Prophase: number of chromosomes in the cell double up</li>
<li>Metaphase: chromosomes wind up and align along the equator of the cells</li>
<li>Anaphase: Chromatids (Not Chromosomes, this is explained later) are drawn towards the ends of the cell by spindle fibers</li>
<li>Telophase: Cell nuclei forms, chromosomes form and unwind</li>
<li>Cytokinesis: Cell splits into two, completing the process of mitosis</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>In the human body, all cells other than sex cells (sperm and ova) are generated through mitosis.</li>
</ul>
<h2>DNA</h2>
<ul>
<li>DNA stands for DeoxyriboNucleic Acid</li>
<li>DNA takes the shape of a Double Helix</li>
</ul>
<img src="https://www.genome.gov/sites/default/files/tg/en/illustration/double_helix.jpg" alt="DNA double helix" style="float:right;" width=20%>
<ul>
<li>The DNA molecule is made up of repeating components known as NUCLEOTIDES</li>
<li>Each nucleotide has three components:
<ul>
<li>A sugar</li>
<li>A Phosphate</li>
<li>One of four nitrogenous bases:
<ul>
<li>A - Ademine</li>
<li>T - Thymine</li>
<li>G - Guanine</li>
<li>C - Cytocine</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Adenine (A) can only pair with Thymine (T), while Guanine (G) can only pair with Cytocine ©</li>
<li>DNA contains all the instructions to make POLYPEPTIDES (Proteins)</li>
<li>The nitrogenous bases bond with each other via hydrogen bonds</li>
<li>DNA is read in groups of three, known as CODONS or TRIPLETS</li>
</ul>
<h2>Mutations</h2>
<blockquote>A MUTATION is the alteration of the nucleotide sequence in the genome of an organism</blockquote>
<blockquote>A MUTAGEN is a physical or chemical agent that changes the genetic material (Usually DNA) of an organism, increasing the frequency of </blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Most mutations are harmless (neutral)</li>
<li>Mutations that IMPROVE survivability are known as BENEFICIAL MUTATIONS</li>
<li>Mutations that DECREASE survivability are known as DETRIMENTAL MUTATIONS</li>
</ul>
<h2>Punnett Squares</h2>
<ul>
<li>Chromosomes contain genes, which dictate traits</li>
<li>An Allele is any of the possible forms of a gene, e.g. Tall/short</li>
<li>Alleles tend to be either Dominant or Recessive. Dominant alleles are represented by a capital letter, while recessive alleles are represented by the same letter, but lower case.</li>
<li>Every chromosome pairs up with another chromosome. The alleles in each pair of chromosomes dictates the properties of the organism. One chromosome is inherited from the organism’s male parent, while the other is inherited from the female parent.</li>
<li>When an organism has a pair of Homozygous Alleles, both chromosomes for that trait have the same allele (Both Dominant or both recessive)</li>
<li>When an organism has Heterozygous Alleles, one chromosome has the Dominant allele, while the other has the recessive allele. An organism with Heterozygous Alleles will display the characteristics of the Dominant Allele.<br>
<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/22/Punnett_Square.svg" alt="Image of a Punnett Square"></li>
<li>A Punnett square is a graphical representation of the chances of an organism having a specific trait.</li>
<li>In the image above, yellow coloring is the dominant allele, while green coloring is the recessive allele.</li>
<li>The yellow parent in the image is Heterozygous for the color trait, while the green parent is Homozygous Recessive for the color trait.</li>
<li>The chart shows that there is a 50% chance of a heterozygous plant, and a 50% chance of a homozygous recessive plant.</li>
<li>Punnett squares can be used for many visible traits (handedness, curly/straight hair, ability to roll tongue, detached earlobes), while other traits, such as some genetic diseases, require more in-depth methods.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Pedigree Charts</h2>
<ul>
<li>A pedigree chart is a diagram that shows the occurence and appearance of phenotypes of a particular gene from one generation to the next.<br>
<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9c/Pedigree-chart-example.svg/769px-Pedigree-chart-example.svg.png" alt="Image of a pedigree chart"></li>
<li>Pedigree charts can be used to find the presence or absence of traits in a bloodline (e.g. CCR-5:Δ32 HIV Immunity)</li>

<details>
<summary> Definitions </summary>

</ul>
</details>
<h2>Periodic Table</h2>
<ul>
<li>The periodic table is a table listing the fundamental building blocks of the universe: elements</li>
<li>NOTE: ATOM and ELEMENT do NOT mean the same thing!
<ul>
<li>An atom is a particle containing protons and electrons (and generally neutrons too)</li>
<li>An element is a substance made out of the SAME TYPE OF ATOM</li>
<li>An atom is the smallest sample of an element.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Atoms have a nucleus (which contains their protons and neutrons) and orbiting shells (which contain electrons in fixed rings)</li>
<li>Electron shells fill from the innermost available space:
<ul>
<li>The first shell can hold a MAXIMUM of 2 electrons</li>
<li>The second shell can hold a maximum of 8 electrons</li>
<li>The third shell can hold 8 electrons until the fourth shell has 2 electrons, then another 10 (total of 18)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<details>
<summary>    This concept is a bit confusing at first. Click here to see how it works </summary>
      - In the fourth period, Potassium has an electron configuration of Potassium is  $ 2,8,8,1 $
      - Calcium is  $ 2,8,8,2 $
      - Scandium is  $ 2,8,9,2 $ . After the 4th shell has 2 electrons, they begin to fill from the 3rd shell until Zinc, which fills the third shell to its capacity of 18 ( $ 2,8,18,2 $ ).
      - After Zinc, electrons fill the outermost shell again until Krypton ( $ 2,8,18,8 $ ), after which the fifth shell starts filling.
      - This trend occurs for shells 3/4 and 4/5.
</details>
  - The fourth shell can hold 8 electrons until the fifth shell has 2 electrons, then another 10 (total of 18)
<h3>Memorising the first 20 elements</h3>
<ul>
<li>There is an easy way to memorise the first 20 elements, the Periodic Table Song</li>
<li>You should memorise up to the first chorus (including the chorus) for Year 10 Chemistry. Year 11 and 12 Chemistry may require more.<br>
<br></li>
</ul>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rz4Dd1I_fX0" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<h3>Representing Atoms</h3>
<ul>
<li>There are several ways to represent an atom.
<ul>
<li>The first way is the atom’s symbol.</li>
<li>The atomic symbol is the one or two letter shortcode for the atom that can be seen on the periodic table.<br>
<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2e/Simple_Periodic_Table_Chart-en.svg" alt="Image of the Periodic Table"></li>
<li>For example, Oxygen is represented as  $ O $ , while Calcium is  $ Ca $</li>
<li>The first letter MUST be capital and the second letter (if present) MUST be lowercase.  $ ca $ ,  $ CA $  or  $ cA $  for Calcium are all INCORRECT answers.</li>
<li>Some elements have atomic symbols which somewhat match their name, such as  $ N $  for Nitrogen</li>
<li>Others seem completely random, such as  $ Au $  for Gold. These tend to come from their Latin names (“Aurum” in the case of Gold)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Another way is by writing out the ELECTRON CONFIGURATION.
<ul>
<li>This is the filling order of the electron shells.</li>
<li>For example, Hydrogen is  $ 1 $ , Oxygen is  $ 2,6 $ , etc.</li>
<li>This method is not often used for naming an element, since electron configurations can change in Chemical Reactions.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Chemical Reactions</h2>
<ul>
<li>A chemical reaction is when the bonds between atoms are broken, formed or changed</li>
<li>A chemical reaction has 2 parts: reactants and products
<ul>
<li>Reactants are the substances BEFORE the reaction</li>
<li>Products are the substances AFTER the reaction</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Law Of Conservation Of Mass</h3>
<ul>
<li>The Law of Conservation of Mass states that:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>Matter cannot be created nor destroyed, it can only be changed from one form to another.</blockquote>
- This means that in a chemical reaction, the total mass of the products MUST be the same as the total mass of the reactants.
- For example, photosynthesis:
  - 6CO2 + 6H2O —> C6H12O6 + 6O2
  - On both sides of the equation, there are:
    - 6 Carbon atoms
    - 6 Oxygen atoms
    - 12 Hydrogen atoms
  - This is known as a BALANCED EQUATION
### Law of Constant Proportions
- The Law of Constant Proportions states that:
- <blockquote>A given chemical compound always contains its components in a fixed ratio.</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>For example, in water, there will ALWAYS be two hydrogen atoms for every oxygen atom (H2O).
<ul>
<li>If there were an equal number of hydrogen and oxygen atoms, then the substance would not be Water (H2O), instead it would be Hydrogen Peroxide (H2O2).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Exothermic and Endothermic Reactions</h3>
<ul>
<li>An EXOTHERMIC REACTION is a reaction that GENERATES heat/energy (exo-: outside, -thermic: heat)</li>
<li>An ENDOTHERMIC REACTION is a reaction that REQUIRES heat/energy (endo-: inside, -thermic: heat)</li>
<li>Sometimes, exothermic reactions require heat to start. However, their total energy output is GREATER than the total energy input</li>
</ul>
<h3>Ionic and Covalent Bonds</h3>
<ul>
<li>An IONIC bond is a bond between oppositely charged IONS (atoms with an unequal number of protons and electrons)</li>
<li>Ionic bonds occur between a metal and a non-metal</li>
<li>One atom will LOSE electrons, and the other will GAIN electrons so that both have a filled outer shell.</li>
<li>For example, in  $ NaCl $ , The Sodium atom loses an electron and the Chlorine atom gains that electron. The two atoms are then electrostatically attracted together.</li>
<li>A COVALENT bond is a bond where two non-metal atoms SHARE a pair of valence electrons</li>
<li>An atom can have multiple covalent bonds. For example, carbon group atoms can have up to four covalent bonds</li>
<li>Noble Gases (group 18) do NOT form bonds with anything (except in rare circumstances)</li>
<li>Two atoms with a covalent bond can be said to be DIATOMIC</li>
</ul>

<h3>Element Groupings</h3>
<ul>
<li>The periodic table has several methods of being divided into categories.</li>
<li>The first method is by PERIOD
<ul>
<li>Elements in horizontal rows are in the same period.</li>
<li>Each at the end of each period, the next electron shell begins to fill.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The second method is by BLOCK
<ul>
<li>Each block of the periodic table is determined by the electron orbitals which are filled in that block.</li>
<li>Each block is named after the orbital which gets filled in that block<br>
<img src="https://www.thoughtco.com/thmb/4QQYiqawXiYyXmWWmORUW5T_zQI=/690x391/filters:fill(auto,1)/ecblocks-56a129535f9b58b7d0bc9f2e.jpg" alt="Image of the periodic table grouped by block"></li>
<li>The s-block is everything in columns 1 and 2, as well as Helium</li>
<li>The d-block is everything from column 3 to 12, except the Lanthanides and Actinides</li>
<li>The p-block is everything from column 13 onwards, except Helium</li>
<li>The f-block is the Lanthanides and Actinides</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The third method is by GROUP
<ul>
<li>Vertical columns of the Periodic Table are known as GROUPS</li>
<li>Elements in the same group have similar properties
<ul>
<li>Group 1: Alkaline Metals</li>
<li>Group 2: Alkaline Earth Metals</li>
<li>Group 3-12: Transition Metals</li>
<li>Group 13: Boron Group</li>
<li>Group 14: Carbon Group</li>
<li>Group 15: Pnictogens</li>
<li>Group 16: Chalcogens</li>
<li>Group 17: Halogens</li>
<li>Group 18: Noble Gases</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

    <title>Science: Distance and Displacement</title>
    <url>/distance-and-displacement/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>Distance: the measurement of the length between two points</li>
<li>Displacement: the CHANGE in an object’s position (straight line between start and end points)</li>
<li>NOTE: An object can travel a large distance and still have zero displacement</li>
<li>Distance is SCALAR (e.g. 10km) while Displacement is a VECTOR (e.g. 10km South)</li>
<li>For example: If you run a 5km on a circular course, your distance traveled is 5 kilometers, regardless of where you started and finished.
<ul>
<li>However, your displacement is ZERO if you finish where you started.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Distance-Over-Time Graphs</h2>
<p><img src="https://csec-cdn.intranet.pw/schoolnotes.intranet.pw/distance-over-time-graph.png" alt="Distance Over Time Graph image"></p>
<ul>
<li>NOTE: in a distance-over-time graph, Distance must ALWAYS be on the Y-Axis, while Time must ALWAYS be on the X-Axis</li>
<li>If the graph is increasing, the object is IN MOTION</li>
<li>If the graph is flat-lining, the object has STOPPED</li>
<li>Distance-over-Time graphs CANNOT DECREASE!!! Only Displacement Graphs can decrease.</li>
<li>Distance-Over-Time graphs must always be above the x-axis.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>NOTE: in a distance-over-time graph, Distance must ALWAYS be on the Y-Axis, while Time must ALWAYS be on the X-Axis</li>
<li>If the graph is flat-lining, the object has STOPPED</li>
<li>If the graph is increasing, the object is moving further from the origin</li>
<li>If the graph is decreasing, the object is moving closer to the origin</li>
<li>If the graph intersects the x-axis, the object is at its starting point.</li>

<ul>
<li>Peter became the leader of the Church.
<li>Christianity remains a sect of Judaism - adherents follow Mosaic Law and the teachings based on Hebrew Scripture, however, they celebrate the Eucharist and Baptism
<li>There was little formal activity in this period, as all believed that Christ's second coming was soon
</li>
</ul>
<li>49 CE (Council of Jerusalem) - Christians were made to abandon all pagan beliefs and follow the decalogue + Jesus' teachings
<ul>
<li>Christianity was opened to the wider world, and all people could join if they renounced pagan ways and joined Christ
<li>The mass following this attracted was a catalyst for the separation from Judaism
<li>The destruction of the Jewish Temple as a result of the failed Jewish Revolt against Romans (66-73 CE) led to mass migration from citizens living in Judea
<li>The growing numbers of followings made formalisation of the belief imminent, which led to Christianity's split from Judaism in 100 CE

<li>64-313 CE (Persecution) - The Jewish people were angered with Christianity's split and were fearful of Roman punishments if Jesus' teachings continued to spread across the Roman Empire.
<ul>
<li>As a result, Christian people were persecuted by the Romans and the Jewish people. During this time, followings declined significantly

<ul>
<li>The Nicene Creed was created at the council of Nicaea (325) which signalled the official beginning of Christianity

   <td>The Trinity is the belief that God exists in a sole form, but has three distinct aspects: Father, Son and Holy Sprit. The Trinity is beyond human comprehension - when Christians are in heaven, they will understand it fully.

<li>Jewish people believe that God is the solve divine God, who was, is and always will be. This poses Judaism as a monotheistic religion.
<ul>
<li>“You shall have no other God before me, you shall not make for yourself an idol”
</li>
</ul>
<li>God is believed to be transcendent, immanent and the Creator. He is separate from the world, however, is still present through the Covenant with Abraham
<li>Adherents avoid material representation of God, believing he is incorporeal - as a result, they avoid iconography and physical representations of Him
<li>Jewish people believe that God is omnipresent, omnipotent and omniscient. Although God is separate from the physical world, He has a deep relationship with humanity through His love for them. Demonstrated in Genesis 1:26 "Then God said, “Let us make mankind in our image, in our likeness, so that they may rule over the fish in the sea and the birds in the sky, over the livestock and all the wild animals,[<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+1%3A26&version=NIV#fen-NIV-26a" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a</a>] and over all the creatures that move along the ground.”
<li>God is good and everything that He creates is good. He does not act out of anger or personal preference, but rather morality itself.
<li>God is holy, “You shall be holy because I the Lord your God am holy” (Lev 19:2). Holiness ennobles ethics, which enables life
<li>Hebrew scripture describes God in three ways
<ul>
<li>As a clan - e.g. God of Abraham and his descendants
<li>God of the land of Israel - Covenant with God and Jews is lined by the land
<li>Universal God - creator of the universe
</li>
</ul>
<li>Jewish people aim to emulate the attributes of God through their lives. They do this in many ways, inclusive of the Shema; a declaration of faith proclaimed twice a day by Jewish adherents. It consists of three Torah passages. The first one demonstrates Jewish monotheism, reading "Hear, O Israel: The Hashem our God, the Hashem is one" Deuteronomy 6:4

    <title>Mathematics: Functions</title>
    <url>/functions/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<h2>Definition</h2>
<ul>
<li>A function is a relation between two sets of data where each input has 1 or less potential outputs</li>
<li>Horizontal Lines, Parabolas, Linear Equations, Hyperbolas, Exponentials, Polynomials and Cubic Graphs are all examples of functions</li>
<li>Circles and Vertical Lines are NOT functions</li>
<li>In other words, functions can be one-to-one or many-to-one relationships, but not one-to-many relationships (In reference to input and output values)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Notation</h2>
<ul>
<li>There are 3 methods of expressing functions:
<ul>
<li>\(y=123\)</li>
<li>\(f(x)=123\)</li>
<li>\(f:x→123\)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>All of the above methods say the same thing:
<ul>
<li>When \(x\) is the input, \(123\) is the output</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>For example:
<ul>
<li>\(y=2x\)</li>
<li>\(f(x)=2x\)</li>
<li>\(f:x→2x\)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>All state that when \(x\) is the input, \(2x\) is the output</li>
</ul>
<h2>Vertical Line Test</h2>
<ul>
<li>The vertical line test is a quick way to test if a graph is a function</li>
<li>If a vertical line can cut the function TWICE OR MORE, the graph is not a function</li>
<li>In the graph below, the red graph is a function, but the blue line is not, because the green vertical line cuts the blue line at 2 points</li>
</ul>

<h2>Set Notation</h2>
<ul>
<li>In set notation, different types of brackets have different meanings:
<ul>
<li>“(” and “)” are used to write a set where the boundaries are <strong>EXCLUDED</strong></li>
<li>“[” and “]” are used to write a set where the boundaries are <strong>INCLUDED</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>\(\infty\) means Infinity while \(- \infty\) means Negative Infinity</li>
<li>\(x\in[1,\infty)\) means that “\(x\) is in the set of all numbers between 1 and infinity”</li>
</ul>
<h2>Domain And Range</h2>
<ul>
<li>All functions have a Domain and Range
<ul>
<li>The domain of a function is all the valid input values</li>
<li>The range of a function is all the valid output values</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Some input values are INVALID and therefore not part of the Domain
<ul>
<li>For Example:
<ul>
<li>In \(g(x)=\sqrt{x}\), only positive values of \(x\) are possible (because negative numbers have no graphable roots)</li>
<li>Therefore, \(x\) must be greater than or equal to zero (0)</li>
<li>This can be expressed as \(x \geq 0\) OR \(x\in(0,\infty)\)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Some output values are INVALID and therefore not part of the Range
<ul>
<li>y-asymptotes are not part of the range</li>
<li>All y values above/below the minimum/maximum y of a graph are not part of the range</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Transformations of a Function (from \(f(x)\))</h2>
<ul>
<li>Vertical Translation Up \(c\) units: \(f(x)+c\)</li>
<li>Vertical Translation Down \(c\) units: \(f(x)-c\)</li>
<li>Horizontal Translation Left \(c\) units: \(f(x+c)\)</li>
<li>Horizontal Translation Right \(c\) units: \(f(x-c)\)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Odd and Even functions</h2>
<ul>
<li>Even Functions:
<ul>
<li>Symmetrical about the y-axis</li>
<li>Rules:
<ul>
<li>\(f(-x)=f(x)\)</li>
<li>If \((x,y)\) is a valid solution to \(f(x)\), \((x,-y)\) is in the same function</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Odd Functions:
<ul>
<li>Symmetrical about the origin \((0,0)\)</li>
<li>Rules:
<ul>
<li>\(f(-x)=-f(x)\)</li>
<li>If \((x,y)\) is a valid solution to \(f(x)\), then \((-x,-y)\) is also a valid solution</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Proving/Solving Odd and Even Functions:
<ol>
<li>Find \(f(-x)\)</li>
<li>Simplify \(f(-x)\)</li>
<li>If \(f(-x) = -f(x)\), the function is ODD</li>
<li>If \(f(-x) = f(x)\), the function is EVEN</li>
<li>If \(f(-x) \neq f(x)\) AND \(f(-x) \neq -f(x)\), the function is NEITHER ODD NOR EVEN</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>

    <title>SOR1 - Principal Beliefs Of Christianity</title>
    <url>/principal-beliefs-christianity/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<h2>Divinity and Humanity of Jesus Christ</h2>
<ul>
<li>Divine: of or pertaining to God</li>
<li>Jesus is 100% divine, God incarnate (made flesh)</li>
<li>Human: of of pertaining to the nature of people</li>
<li>Jesus is 100% Human</li>
<li>Jesus being both 100% divine and 100% human is known as “Hypostatic Union”</li>
<li>Jesus is the Word of God made flesh (John 1:1, John 1:14)</li>
<li>His divinity is evident through the Gospel testimonies of the miracles and healings performed by Jesus</li>
<li>His humanity is evident through his life as a carpenter and his suffering on the Cross</li>
</ul>
<h3>Council of Nicaea - 325CE</h3>
<ul>
<li>Early Christian thinkers argued over Jesus’ dual nature, and found it difficult to explain how and why God ‘was a man’.</li>
<li>Disputes arose over the many competing explanations, such as:
<ul>
<li>Docetism: is a position which undermines the integrity of the humanity of Jesus because it claims that Jesus is fully divine but not truly human, because he is God merely adopting the appearance of being human.</li>
<li>Arianism: is the belief that Jesus is superior to the rest of creation but not equal to God because Jesus was created by God and thus is not eternal unlike God.</li>
<li>Nestorianism: Nestorius undermined the unity of Jesus by claiming that Mary was the Mother of the human Jesus but not the divine Jesus, to suggest that there were two persons within Jesus</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The Council of Nicaea produced the Nicene Creed, which states that the Father and the Son are of one essence and hence Jesus is fully divine.</li>
<li>The Council of Nicaea also canonized (made the concept legitimate) the Holy Trinity</li>
<li>This decision was reaffirmed by the Council of Constantinople</li>
</ul>
<h2>The Nature of God and Trinity</h2>
<ul>
<li>Christians believe that God is:
<ul>
<li>Transcendant</li>
<li>Immanent</li>
<li>Omnipotent</li>
<li>Omniscient</li>
<li>Omnipresent</li>
<li>Eternal</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Christians believe that God is One and the Creator of all things
<ul>
<li>One being existing in three distinct persons: the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit (Holy Trinity)</li>
<li>Each person is distinct but not isolated from one another</li>
<li>Concept of the Trinity was canonized at the Council of Nicaea</li>
<li>The divine power is common to all three, but they are distinct people/beings</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Death and Resurrection</h2>
<ul>
<li>Jesus was crucified</li>
<li>Resurrected 3 days later</li>
<li>Passion of Christ: Events from Jesus’ arrest until his death</li>
<li>The belief is that Jesus’ death was important to destroy sin and give humanity the opportunity for eternal life (Romans 8:3-4)</li>
<li>Christians believe God has revealed himself in creation through:
<ul>
<li>The teachings and writings of the Prophets</li>
<li>The Holy Spirit</li>
<li>In the person, life and teachings of Jesus Christ</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Christians believe that the Resurrection of the Body will occur for all at the Final Judgement</li>
</ul>
<h2>Revelation</h2>
<ul>
<li>The notion that God is intimately involved with all aspects of human life
<ul>
<li>Thus God is revealed to humankind in and through the experiences of human history</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>God is the ONLY source of Revelation</li>
<li>He has revealed himself through:
<ul>
<li>Creation</li>
<li>Writings of Prophets</li>
<li>Jesus</li>
<li>The Holy Spirit</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Further communicated through:</li>
<li>The Bible</li>
<li>The teaching traditions of the Church (Inspired by the Holy Spirit)</li>
<li>God’s spirit that dwells within human beings</li>
<li>Orthodox and Catholic denominations place a greater emphasis on the teaching authority of the Church, which is considered equal to the Bible in terms of importance</li>
</ul>
<h3>Bible Passage References</h3>
<ul>

</ul>
<h2>Salvation</h2>
<ul>
<li>Refers to the deliverance and liberation from sin and its consequences</li>
<li>GOD is the only one who saves
<ul>
<li>His saving action has particular concern/preference for those who are vulnerable in society</li>
<li>Christians are called to accept the gift of God’s saving action through their faith in Jesus and their own actions on behalf of those in need</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Salvation Realised</h3>
<ul>
<li>Cannot be fully completed in this life → full realisation must be completed in the afterlife</li>
<li>Can be achieved through the acceptance of the life, death and resurrection of Jesus Christ</li>
<li>Humans can only achieve salvation with the grace of GOD</li>
<li>“Born Again” Christians believe that salvation is dependent on an individual’s personal acceptance of Jesus</li>
<li>Other Christians believe that it is not only based on personal faith but also works of merit</li>
</ul>

    <title>SOR1 - Sacred Texts Of Christianity</title>
    <url>/sacred-texts-christianity/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<h2>Books of the Bible</h2>
<ul>
<li>The Bible can be broken down into 2 parts:
<ul>
<li>Old Testament: Hebrew Bible consisting of the 24 books of the TaNaKh (can be divided into Torah, Nevi’im and Ketuvim)
<ul>
<li>Also contains the Apocrypha/Deuterocanon, which are disputed books (Catholics and Orthodox recognise these books as part of the Bible, Protestants do not)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>New Testament: 27 books about the life and actions of Jesus, consists of 4 Gospels (Matthew, Mark, Luke, John), followed by the Acts of the Apostles, then the 21 Epistles (Letters) and the Book of Revelation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Note: Jesus did not exist in the Old Testament because he was NOT BORN YET!!!</li>
</ul>
<h2>Why is the Bible important for Christians?</h2>
<ul>
<li>Allows Christians to form a foundation of their relationship with God
<ul>
<li>Reinforcing Passage: Deuteronomy 6:7</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Provides a model for ethics and behavior (Mostly through the actions and words of Jesus in the New Testament)
<ul>
<li>Reinforcing Passage: Matthew 5-7 (Sermon on the Mount)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Enables spiritual education
<ul>
<li>Reinforcing Passage: Ephesians 6:4</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Facilitates/enables public and private worship
<ul>
<li>Reinforcing Passage: Psalm 149:1-9</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

    <title>Things in Programming</title>
    <url>/Things-in-Programming/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<h2>Types of Things in Programming</h2>
<ul>
<li>Variables – Stored data</li>
<li>Functions – code that does stuff</li>
<li>Loops – A function that runs when its conditions are met</li>
</ul>
<h2>Variables:</h2>
<ul>
<li>There are 6 important types of variables:</li>
<li>Integers – Any whole number
<ul>
<li>Floats – Floating point number, any decimal</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Null – No value (NOT THE SAME AS 0)
<ul>
<li>Chars – Single characters, can be letters or numbers</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Boolean – True/False</li>
<li>String – Anything that doesn’t fit into the above categories. ALWAYS has to be enclosed in quote marks</li>
<li>Variables tend to be created with the following structure:
<ul>
<li><type> <name> = <value></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>For example: int hello = 5</li>
<li>Create an integer named “hello” that has the value of 5</li>
<li>If the command value(hello) is called, the interpreter will return 5</li>
<li>NOTE: VARIABLE NAMES CANNOT CONTAIN SPACES!!!</li>
</ul>
<h2>Functions</h2>
<ul>
<li>Commands that do things, for example:
<ul>
<li>echo/log/print to print text</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>add(1,2) will compute 1+2 and return 3</li>
<li>Functions are specific to programming languages</li>
<li>Functions can also be created using def(), func() or function()
<ul>
<li>For Example:</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>def hello_world(): <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;print(“Hello world!”) </blockquote>
    - Would generate the output:
<blockquote>Hello world!</blockquote>
## Loops
-	Loops are functions that execute if their conditions are met
-	Types of loops include:
	 - If loops: IF Condition is met, do XYZ
   - While loops: WHILE Condition is met, do XYZ
   - For loops: iterates over a sequence
    - Example: for every letter in string(“banana”), add 1 to int(number_of_letters)
      - Will result in int(number_of_letters) to equal 6
-	Loops can be nested inside one another.

    <title>SOR1 - The Development of Early Christian Communities</title>
    <url>/development-early-christianity/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<h2>Pentecost</h2>
<ul>
<li>Fifty days after the resurrection of Christ</li>
<li>Descent of the Holy Spirit</li>
<li>Symbolised the Birth of the Church</li>
</ul>
<h2>The Jesus Movement</h2>
<ul>
<li>30-60 AD</li>
<li>Period immediately after the death of Jesus</li>
<li>Early Christians saw themselves as a sect of Judaism, not an independent religion
<ul>
<li>believed that they were living in the last days before the Parousia (second coming of Christ)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>No proper governing body to determine which Jewish practices should be adhered to</li>
<li>Persecuted by both Jews and Romans, who saw them as heretics
<ul>
<li>The titles given by Christians to Jesus (such as Lord) were reserved for Caesarea (Emperors’ family, rulers)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>The Leaders</h2>
<ul>
<li>Small groups of Palestinian Jews followed disciples such as Peter in and around Palestine</li>
<li>Larger groups of Diaspora Jews (Jews that were not in Israel/Palestine) and Gentiles (Non-Jews) responded to the teachings of Paul</li>
<li>Peter was the first Pope</li>
<li>Paul created the structure of the Christian Church</li>
</ul>
<h2>The Council Of Jerusalem - 50 AD</h2>
<ul>
<li>Purpose was to remove the differences within the early Church</li>
<li>Removed the requirement for circumcision, amongst other changes</li>
</ul>
<h2>New Testament Period - 45-100 AD</h2>
<ul>
<li>Gradual formation and centralization of Christian Churches</li>
<li>Establishing independence from Judaism</li>
<li>Caused by the delay of the Parousia and the deaths of the Apostles</li>
</ul>
<h2>Emperor NERO and the Great Fire - 64 AD</h2>
<ul>
<li>Christians were blamed for a fire that burned down a large portion of Rome</li>
<li>Triggered a mass persecution of Christians, who were already hated for their non-conformity and intolerance of other religions</li>
<li>Resulted in the deaths of Paul and Peter</li>
</ul>
<h2>Emperor DIOCLETIAN Augustus and the Last Persecution - 303 AD</h2>
<ul>
<li>The last of the Ten Persecutions of the Early Church</li>
<li>Ended with the reign of Emperor CONSTANTINE, who established Christianity as the religion of the Empire</li>
<li>In 302 AD, Roman rulers declared an edict to destroy churches, burn scripture and enslave those who persevered in following Christianity</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>To tear down the churches to the foundations and to destroy the Sacred Scriptures by fire; and commanding also that those who were in honorable stations should be degraded if they persevered in their adherence to Christianity </blockquote>
- Followed by 2 more edicts declaring that Christian leaders should be tortured until they gave up their faith
## Emperor CONSTANTINE and the Edict of Milan - 312 AD
- Emperor CONSTANTINE declared tolerance for Christianity throughout the Roman Empire
- Ordered land from churches to be returned to Christians
## Council of Nicea - 352 AD
- Called by Emperor Constantine to restore religious peace
- Pope Sylvester and several bishops attended
- Purpose was to sort out theological differences between Christian groups, such as the divine status of Christ
- Resulted in the creation of the Nicene Creed
- Council of Chalcedeon (451 AD) clarified that Jesus was both fully God and fully Man

<li>h<sup>0</sup> = 1</li>
<li>Therefore, y = 1+b</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Asymptote: A line which the graph CANNOT cross, Asymptote = b</li>
<li>X-Intercept: Must be calculated manually, only present if b &lt; 0</li>
</ul>
<h3>Transformations of an Exponential Graph</h3>
<ul>
<li>Move graph up: increase b</li>
<li>Move graph down: decrease b</li>
<li>Increase steepness: increase h</li>
<li>Decrease steepness: decrease h</li>
<li>Reflect in Y-axis: x * -1</li>
<li>Reflect in X-axis: h * -1</li>
<li>Move graph left n units: x + n</li>
<li>Move graph right n units: x - n</li>
</ul>
<h2>Circles</h2>
<ul>
<li>Standard Form: \((x-h)^2+(y-k)^2=r^2\)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Features of a Circle</h3>
<ul>
<li>Y-intercepts</li>
<li>X-intercepts</li>
<li>Note: if \(h\) and \(k\) are both zero, then the \(x\) and \(y\) intercepts are \(r\) and \(-1 \times r\)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Transformations of a Circle</h3>
<p>Note: these will seem incorrect, but just try plotting them first. The confusion arises because the circle formula uses a minus sign.</p>
<ul>
<li>Move graph up: decrease k</li>
<li>Move graph down: increase k</li>
<li>Increase steepness: increase x-coefficient</li>
<li>Decrease steepness: decrease x-coefficient</li>
<li>Increase width: increase y-coefficient</li>
<li>Decrease width: decrease y-coefficient</li>
<li>Move graph left: decrease h</li>
<li>Move graph right: increase h</li>
</ul>
<h2>Hyperbola</h2>
<ul>
<li>Standard Form: \(y = \frac{a}{x-h} +k\)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Transformations of a Hyperbola</h3>
<ul>
<li>Vertical Translation Up: increase k</li>
<li>Vertical Translation Down: decrease k</li>
<li>Horizontal Translation Left: decrease h</li>
<li>Horizontal Translation Right: increase h</li>
<li>Reflect in y-axis: \(a \times -1\)</li>
<li>Move vertices closer to center: decrease a</li>
<li>Move vertices further from center: increase a</li>
</ul>
<h2>Cubic Graph</h2>
<ul>
<li>Standard Form: \(y=(ax+b)^3+d\)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Transformations of a Cubic Graph</h3>

    <title>Science - Cloning</title>
    <url>/cloning/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<h2>Cloning</h2>
<ul>
<li>A clone is an organism that was made by exactly copying the genetic sequence of another organism. Cloning occurs in nature. Examples of natural cloning include mitosis and banana plants.</li>
<li>Types of cloning:
<ul>
<li>Nuclear Transfer Cloning:
<ul>
<li>Somatic: any cell that is not a sperm or egg.</li>
<li>The nucleus of one somatic cell and egg cell is taken out and the somatic cell’s nucleus is implanted into the egg’s empty space where its nucleus used to be</li>
<li>Eventually the egg begins to divide (this does not always happen, and is why Nuclear Transfer Cloning is not very efficient), and becomes a full organism</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Therapeutic Cloning: An embryo is cloned in the normal way, but instead of letting it develop into a fetus/organism, it’s interrupted at the blastocyst stage (when it’s still just a ball of cells) and used to repair cellular damage to a patient.
<ul>
<li>This is useful because the cells in a blastocyst are “stem cells”: they have not yet differentiated, so they can become any kind of tissue needed.</li>
<li>Therapeutic</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Dolly the Sheep</h3>
<h6>Dolly the Sheep was the first ever mammal to be cloned</h6>
<ul>
<li>1/400 attempts successful</li>
<li>around 300 embryos used</li>
<li>Dolly died at 6 years old (most sheep die at around 12) due to a lung disease, NOT cloning</li>
<li>First step towards human cloning</li>
<li>Cloning the best cattle for meat and milk production</li>
<li>Embryonic stem cells for medical use</li>
<li>Clones as “spare parts” for humans</li>
<li>Negatively affected stem cell research by association</li>
<li>Cloning research moved to countries with less restrictions (Such as China and Japan)</li>

    <title>SOR1 - Core Ethical Teachings of Judaism</title>
    <url>/core-ethical-teachings-judaism/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p><a name="top"></a></p>
<h2>Commandment to study the Torah</h2>
<ul>
<li>The ethical and moral teachings of Judaism are grounded in the Torah, the rule of life.
<ul>
<li>To learn Torah and to teach it (Deuteronomy 6:7)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Halachah</h3>
<ul>
<li>Halachah is the legal component of Judaism</li>
<li>It is concerned with guiding adherents with right relationship with G-d and others</li>
<li>It helps to elaborate on the essence of Jewish ethical living</li>
<li>The basis for Halachah is grounded in the commandments of the Torah (613 mitzvot), and are expanded/clarified in The Talmud</li>
</ul>
<h3>Mitzvot</h3>
<ul>
<li>The fundamental source of ethical guidance for Jews is the Torah, which includes the Written and Oral Torah (Talmud).</li>
<li>The 613 mitzvot can be further divided into two categories, positive mitzvot and negative mitzvot.
<ul>
<li>Positive mitzvot are commands to perform an act, for example to love one’s neighbour.</li>
<li>Negative mitzvot are commands to refrain from doing something, for example do not murder</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>The Ten Commandments</h3>
<ul>
<li>The Ten Commandments are a summary of the 613 mitzvot → they are the core of the commandments</li>
<li>The Ten Commandments can be separated into 2 groups
<ul>
<li>The first 5 deal with the relationship between G-d and the people of Israel</li>
<li>The last 5 are concerned with the relationship between an individual and other people</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Prophetic Vision/Tikkun Olam</h2>
<ul>
<li>The Prophets are individuals who experienced the call of G-d to bring a message to their community.
<ul>
<li>They were often reluctant to accept their mandate and many suffered greatly due to the controversial nature of their message.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The Prophets frequently broke the status quo and confronted authority in their communities. They were often called to proclaim a message arguing that people were straying from the path set down by the Torah.</li>
<li>They also were frequently called to challenge the apathy of people and to insist that they take a more pro-active stance in reforming social structures to achieve a situation where equality, justice and peace would prevail.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Tikkun Olam</h3>
<ul>
<li>‘Repair of the world’
<ul>
<li>Genesis 1: … And God said, ‘it is good’…</li>
<li>The reparation or improving of the world to the harmonious state in which it was created.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The message of the Hebrew prophets that has echoed down through the ages</li>
<li>Jewish principle of commitment to social justice and social order in partnership with God</li>
<li>Recognises the importance of each individual’s contribution towards perfecting the world - recognises that this is not one’s persons job</li>
</ul>
<h3>Tzedakah</h3>
<ul>
<li>Tzedakah is a specific ethical teaching within Tikkun Olam. It means:
<ul>
<li>Almsgiving or giving away of material possession</li>
<li>All Jews are required to give tzedakah within means which are reasonable for each individual. Hence, an individual must not endanger his or her own life to perform this mitzvah.</li>
<li>Tzedakah does not only stress the importance of giving donations but it also highlights the importance of how one gives and hence provides guidelines of what is deemed acceptable when one gives tzedakah.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Ethical teaching about being charitable and giving to those in need (Similar to the Catholic Social Teaching of Preferential option for the poor)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Gemilut Chasidim</h3>
<ul>
<li>Gemilut chasidim is a specific ethical teaching within ‘Tikkun Olam’
<ul>
<li>Deeds of love and kindness</li>
<li>Includes things like visiting the sick, giving hospitality, feeding the poor, comforting a mourner and attending a funeral</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Bal Tashkit</h3>
<ul>
<li>Bal Tashkit is a notion that prohibits the unnecessary destruction of God’s creation whether it is flora of fauna.</li>
<li>Bal Tashkit prohibits the needless destruction and degradation of the environment, thus it promotes respect and care for the environment, and emphasises the notion of human stewardship for the earth.</li>
<li>Conservation of the environment and avoiding unnecessary destructive actions.</li>
</ul>
<h2>The Book of Proverbs</h2>
<ul>
<li>Part of the Ketuvim (writings)</li>
<li>Ascribed to King Solomon</li>
<li>Much to do with wisdon (application of knowledge)
<ul>
<li>Demonstrates the importance of studying the Torah</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Practical guide, not theological</li>
<li>Builds positive characteristics:
<ul>
<li>wisdom</li>
<li>righteousness</li>
<li>purity</li>
<li>generosity of spirit</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Relates to ethics as ethics is the study of right and wrong behaviour. These themes ensure that the RIGHT BEHAVIOUR is implemented with the RIGHT INTENTIONS</li>
</ul>

    <title>SOR1 - Sacred Texts of Judaism</title>
    <url>/sacred-texts-of-judaism/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<h2>TaNaKh</h2>
<ul>
<li>Consists of 21 books</li>
<li>Some sources originate from nearly 2000 years ago</li>
<li>Three Major Books:
<ul>
<li>Torah (Teachings)</li>
<li>Neviim (Prophets)</li>
<li>Ketuvim (Writings)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Originally written in Hebrew</li>
<li>Themes: crisis and exile, alienation and reconciliation</li>
</ul>

<li>Psalms</li>
<li>Job</li>
<li>Proverbs</li>
<li>Ruth</li>
<li>Song of Songs</li>
<li>Ecclesiastes</li>
<li>Lamentations</li>
<li>Esther</li>
<li>Daniel</li>
<li>Ezra-Nehemiah</li>
<li>Chronicles</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Believed to have been written under Divine Inspiration</li>
</ul>
<h2>Talmud</h2>
<ul>
<li>A legal commentary on the TaNaKh, explaining how its commandments are to be lived out</li>
<li>Consists of two books
<ul>
<li>Mishnah</li>
<li>Gemara</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The Mishnah is the Oral Law. It includes lessons and quotations from sages, scholars and rabbis.</li>
<li>The Mishnah is organised as a legal book, while the Torah is arranged like a narrative</li>

<li>The Mishnah is the Core Text of the Talmud, while the Gemara serves as an expansion, “completing” the Talmud</li>
<li>Both texts explore the reasoning behind the principles of the Torah, as well as situations where an action might not be considered a violation of Mitzvot.</li>
<li>They also serve as a final legal ruling on contradictions in the Torah, providing a definitive answer to issues of conflict.</li>
</ul>

    <title>SOR1 - Principle Beliefs of Judaism</title>
    <url>/principle-beliefs-of-judaism/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<h2>Belief in One God</h2>
<ul>
<li>One God who is the Creator and Ruler of the Universe</li>
<li>Most fundamental Jewish belief</li>
<li>God is known as YHWH (Yahweh)</li>
<li>This belief forms the center of the Shema Prayer:
<ul>
<li>“Hear O Israel, God is Our God, God the One and Only” (Deuteronomy 6:4)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>G-d is both Transcendent and Immanent:
<ul>
<li>Transcendent: G-d is intangible/not of physical form</li>
<li>Immanent: G-d interacts with people’s lives through the Covenant</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>G-d is Omnipresent, Omnipotent and Omniscient (G-d is everywhere, knows everything and is all-powerful)</li>
<li>G-d is referred to as Anthropomorphic in the TaNaKh. While G-d is canonically intangible, many sections of the TaNaKh seem to imply that G-d has a physical form, such as Genesis 2, where G-d “breathed into his (Adam’s) nostrils the breath of life.”</li>
</ul>
<h2>Divinely Inspired Moral law</h2>
<ul>
<li>Laws given by G-d to guide Jews in ethics and morality</li>
<li>The belief that G-d has provided Jewish Adherents with a code of ethics to guide them in their daily decisions</li>
<li>Jews are encouraged to study the Torah in order to understand G-d’s teachings</li>
<li>Binds Jews to G-d</li>
<li>Also known as MITZVOT
<ul>
<li>248 do’s</li>
<li>365 don’ts</li>
<li>Covers all aspects of life as a Jew (marriage, Shabbat, Passover, Sabbath)</li>
</ul>
<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Variant</th>
    <th>Beliefs around the Mitzvot/Divinely Inspired Moral Law</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Orthodox</td>
    <td>- The moral code laid down by G-d is complete and non-evolving in its application to all situations for the past, present and future.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td></td>
    <td>- The main role of Talmudic scholars and halakhic lawyers is to find the exact authority within the text to justify behaviour for the case at hand.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Conservative</td>
    <td>- The Written Torah is open to some re-interpretation in light of changing circumstances as the text does not represent the literal word of God.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Progressive</td>
    <td>- Place greater emphasis on the broad principles established in the moral to guide ethical decision making in new situations.</td>
  </tr>
</table>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>The Covenant</h2>
<ul>
<li>A promise from G-d to the Jewish people in exchange for certain obligations</li>
<li>Affirms the unique relationship between G-d and the Jewish people</li>
<li>Halachah: Jewish Law
<ul>
<li>The covenant is a legal requirement for Jews. By breaking the Laws, you abandon toe Covenant</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Example: Noahic Covenant
<ul>
<li>Obligation: Noah and his family were called to live in G-d’s image and walk His path by caring for all of Creation</li>
<li>Privilege: G-d promised to save Noah’s family from the Flood</li>
<li>Sign of the Covenant: <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Gen+9%3A12%E2%80%9317&amp;version=NRSV" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Rainbow</a></li>

    <title>Science - Mutations</title>
    <url>/mutations/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<h2>DNA</h2>
<ul>
<li>DNA stands for DeoxyriboNucleic Acid</li>
<li>DNA has the shape of a double helix (like a twisted ladder)</li>
<li>The DNA molecule is made up of repeating components called NUCLEOTIDES</li>
<li>Nucleotides consist of three components:
<ul>
<li>A Sugar</li>
<li>A Phosphate</li>
<li>One of 4 Nitrogenous Bases:
<ul>
<li>Adenine (A)</li>
<li>Thymine (T)</li>
<li>Guanine (G)</li>
<li>Cytosine (C)</li>
<li>NOTE: You only need to know the letters, not the full names</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Adenine can only pair with Thymine, while Guanine can only pair with Cytosine</li>
<li>Nitrogenous bases pair through Hydrogen bonds</li>
<li>DNA contains all the instructions to create an organism</li>
<li>Key term: POLYPEPTIDE, also known as a protein</li>
<li>DNA is read in groups of three, called a CODON or a triplet</li>
</ul>
<h2>Mutations</h2>
<ul>
<li>A MUTATION is the alteration of the nucleotide sequence in the genome of an organism</li>
<li>A MUTAGEN is a physical or chemical agent that changes the genetic material of an organism, increasing the frequency of mutations in an organism</li>
<li>Most mutations are harmless (NEUTRAL)</li>
<li>Mutations that improve survivability are called BENEFICIAL mutations</li>
<li>Mutations that decrease survivability are called DETRIMENTAL mutations</li>
</ul>
<h3>Examples of mutations</h3>
<p>Beneficial:</p>
<ul>
<li>Name: CCR-5 HIV Immunity</li>
<li>How does it occur?: Homozygous allele Δ32 (Delta-32) at the CCR-5 gene locus
<ul>
<li>The CCR-5 gene has the Δ32 allele on both chromosomes. Δ32 is a RECESSIVE gene.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>What is the benefit?: People with this mutation are completely immune to HIV.</li>
</ul>
<p>Detrimental:</p>
<ul>
<li>Name: Sickle Cell Anaemia</li>
<li>How does it occur?: recessive allele in the Beta Globin gene
<ul>
<li>The Beta Globin gene has the recessive allele on both chromosomes.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>What is the detriment?: Sickle Cell Anaemia causes the hemoglobin protein, which carries oxygen in red blood cells, to be malformed. This means that the red blood cell has a significantly lower oxygen capacity, resulting in lack of oxygen to muscles and organs. This also results in the blood cells taking on a sickle shape rather than the normal torus (doughnut) shape. However, Sickle Cell Anaemia provides immunity to malaria, which may explain why it is quite common in Sub-Saharan Africa.</li>

    <title>Science - Fossils</title>
    <url>/fossils/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<h2>Fossils</h2>
<ul>
<li>A fossil is evidence of past life.</li>
<li>Fossils can be part of an organism, such as its bones, teeth, feathers, scales, branches or leaves.</li>
<li>Fossils can also be traces, such as footprints, burrows and other evidence that an organism existed in an area.</li>
<li>Fossils provide evidence that life has changed over time. Some life forms that used to exist on Earth no longer exist.</li>
<li>Studying the fossil record also provides evidence that life forms have become more complex over time.</li>
<li>The study of fossils is called Palaeontology.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Major Milestones in the history of life</h2>
<ul>
<li>Ice Ages</li>
<li>Cambrian Explosion</li>
<li>Photosynthesis</li>
<li>Merger between mitochondria and anaerobic organisms</li>
<li>Formation of the KT Boundary (Extinction of the dinosaurs)</li>
<li>Motion of tectonic plates</li>
<li>Land animals developing eggs</li>
<li>Animals moving onto Land</li>
</ul>
<h2>Formation of life on Earth</h2>
<ol>
<li>Planet Earth forms</li>
<li>Core and Crust forms</li>
<li>First Oceans</li>
<li>First Life (Cyanobacteria or Archea)</li>
<li>Oxygen accumulates in the atmosphere</li>
<li>First Animals</li>
<li>First Vertebrates (Fish)</li>
<li>First land plants</li>
<li>Dinosaurs</li>
<li>Dinosaurs go Extinct</li>
<li>Humans</li>
</ol>
<h2>Theory of evolution</h2>
<ul>
<li>All life on Earth shares a common ancestor.</li>
<li>All the different species on Earth underwent mutations in the past to better suit their environment.</li>
<li>Evolution (Not Theory of Evolution) means “descent with modification”</li>
</ul>
<h2>Natural Selection</h2>
<ul>
<li>Natural selection is the concept of survival of the fittest.</li>
<li>There are 4 conditions for natural selections: variation between individuals, heredity, reproduction and variation of fitness</li>
<li>Selective pressures are phenomena that impact on an organism’s fitness</li>
</ul>
<h3>Stages of Natural Selection</h3>
<h4>1. Isolation</h4>
<ul>
<li>A species becomes separated by an environmental factor e.g. formation of a river</li>
</ul>
<h4>2. Variation</h4>
<ul>
<li>A mutation occurs in one of the isolated groups</li>
</ul>
<h4>3. Selection</h4>
<ul>
<li>If the mutation improves fitness, the mutation is passed on to the next generation</li>
</ul>
<h4>4. Speciation</h4>
<ul>
<li>After several generations, the isolated group has a majority of individuals carrying the mutation, and these individuals are considered to have evolved.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Law of Superposition</h2>
<ul>
<li>Because upper layers are younger than the ones beneath them, the law of superposition states that a fossil’s age can be determined by the age of fossils around them. This only applies to UNDISTURBED rock.</li>
<li>Relative age: age of the fossil based on the Law of Superposition, e.g. Fossil A is older than Fossil B but younger than fossil C.</li>
<li>Absolute age: the actual age of the fossil, e.g. Fossil A is 6000 years old.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Analysing the Fossil record</h2>
<ul>
<li>Faulting can cause projections of rock through other layers.</li>
<li>Folding results in layers of rock being moved away from each other.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Why are fossils important?</h2>
<ul>
<li>Fossils allow us to determine early biodiversity</li>
<li>Fossils can be compared to modern day organisms</li>
<li>Fossils improve our understanding of previous conditions on Earth</li>
<li>Fossils support our estimates for the age of the Earth</li>
<li>Fossils provide evidence for Evolution</li>
<li>Fossils provide evidence of continental drift</li>
</ul>

    <content><![CDATA[<h2>Mitosis</h2>
<ul>
<li>Mitosis is the process by which one parent cell splits into two identical daughter cells.</li>
<li>Mitosis is the most common method of reproduction for single-celled organisms.</li>
<li>There are 5 main stages of mitosis:</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>Prophase: number of chromosomes in the cell double up</li>
<li>Metaphase: chromosomes wind up and align along the equator of the cells</li>
<li>Anaphase: Chromatids (Not Chromosomes, this is explained later) are drawn towards the ends of the cell by spindle fibers</li>
<li>Telophase: Cell nuclei forms, chromosomes form and unwind</li>
<li>Cytokinesis: Cell splits into two, completing the process of mitosis</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>In the human body, all cells other than sex cells (sperm and ova) are generated through mitosis.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Punnett Squares</h2>
<ul>
<li>Chromosomes contain genes, which dictate traits</li>
<li>An Allele is any of the possible forms of a gene, e.g. Tall/short</li>
<li>Alleles tend to be either Dominant or Recessive. Dominant alleles are represented by a capital letter, while recessive alleles are represented by the same letter, but lower case.</li>
<li>Every chromosome pairs up with another chromosome. The alleles in each pair of chromosomes dictates the properties of the organism. One chromosome is inherited from the organism’s male parent, while the other is inherited from the female parent.</li>
<li>When an organism has a pair of Homozygous Alleles, both chromosomes for that trait have the same allele (Both Dominant or both recessive)</li>
<li>When an organism has Heterozygous Alleles, one chromosome has the Dominant allele, while the other has the recessive allele. An organism with Heterozygous Alleles will display the characteristics of the Dominant Allele.</li>
</ul>

    <title>Writing Guide</title>
    <url>/writing-guide/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<h2>How to Write Posts</h2>
<p>Not following these rules will result in your post not being posted!!!</p>
<h3>Essentials:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Learn basic Markdown formatting.
<ul>
<li>Markdown is a lightweight and easily readable format for websites.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Guide to formatting in Markdown</a></li>
<li>If you are writing up mathematics pages, format math stuff using MathJax (<a href="https://math.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/5020/mathjax-basic-tutorial-and-quick-reference" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Guide</a>)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Formatting Rules:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Header Block:
<ul>
<li>Title should be structured as: <code>Subject - Topic - Year Level (optional)</code></li>
<li>For example: <code>SOR1 - Core Ethical Teachings of Judaism - Year 11</code></li>
<li>If you are a writer for the site, you will be provided with a writer ID. In the header of each post, add the line <code>discussionId: writer_id-post_number</code></li>
<li>For example: <code>W1234-P10</code> where <code>W1234</code> is the writer ID and <code>P10</code> is the 10th post by that writer.</li>
<li>Anonymous posts should use writer ID <code>WA1</code> with no post number. A post number will be assigned randomly after moderation. Identified writers will only be moderated for the first post, and randomly after that.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Post Contents:
<ul>
<li>DO NOT REPEAT THE TOPIC!!!</li>
<li>Syllabus points and learning intentions should be placed at the end of the post (Optional but recommended)</li>
<li>Subheadings start from h2 (##). Every sub-sub heading should have another # added to it.
<ul>
<li>For example, on this page, <code>How to write posts</code> is h2 (##). <code>Formatting Rules</code> is h3 (###). More #'s means another sub-topic.</li>
<li>If a component has 3 or more subheadings, it should probably be a separate post.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Break down the information into dot points (i.e. lines should start with a dash <code>-</code> or an asterisk <code>*</code>).</li>
<li>No more than 2 sentences per dot point.</li>
<li>You CAN stack points by indenting them (add a space before the dash/asterisk).
<ul>
<li>If a point has more than 3 indents, it should probably have its own heading.</li>
<li>Stacked points can be used to elaborate or define key points/terms (HIGHLY RECOMMENDED)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Images/diagrams can be used, and are recommended for subjects such as sciences, math and TAS subjects (Art, music, technology, STEM, etc.)</li>
<li>Include a table of definitions and Subject-Specific Terminology (If needed) at the end of the post. Also include your name and best contact email. (See sample Markdown document)
<ul>
<li>Tables should be in HTML due to a bug in the render engine. <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_tables.asp" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Guide for HTML Tables</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
