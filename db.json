Some life forms that used to exist on Earth no longer exist.\n* Studying the fossil record also provides evidence that life forms have become more complex over time.\n* The study of fossils is called Palaeontology.\n## Major Milestones in the History of Life\n- Ice Ages\n- Cambrian Explosion\n- Photosynthesis\n- Merger between mitochondria and anaerobic organisms\n- Formation of the KT Boundary (Extinction of the dinosaurs)\n- Motion of tectonic plates\n- Land animals developing eggs\n- Animals moving onto Land\n## Formation of life on Earth\n 1.

Humans\n## Theory of evolution\n- All life on Earth shares a common ancestor.\n- All the different species on Earth underwent mutations in the past to better suit their environment.\n- Evolution (Not Theory of Evolution) means \"descent with modification\"\n- Darwin's Theory of Evolution states that all life shares a common ancestor, and that the differences between life forms is explained by Survival of the Fittest\n\n## Natural Selection\n- Natural selection is the concept of survival of the fittest.\n- There are 4 conditions for natural selections: variation between individuals, heredity, reproduction and variation of fitness\n- Selective pressures are phenomena that impact on an organism's fitness\n\n### Stages of Natural Selection\n#### 1. Isolation\n- A species becomes separated by an environmental factor e.g. formation of a river\n#### 2. Variation\n- A mutation occurs in one of the isolated groups\n#### 3. Selection\n- If the mutation improves fitness, the mutation is passed on to the next generation\n#### 4. Speciation\n- After several generations, the isolated group has a majority of individuals carrying the mutation, and these individuals are considered to have evolved.\n## Law of Superposition\n- Because upper layers are younger than the ones beneath them, the law of superposition states that a fossil's age can be determined by the age of fossils around them. This only applies to UNDISTURBED rock.\n- Relative age: age of the fossil based on the Law of Superposition, e.g. Fossil A is older than Fossil B but younger than fossil C.\n- Absolute age: the actual age of the fossil, e.g. Fossil A is 6000 years old.\n## Analysing the Fossil record\n- Faulting can cause projections of rock through other layers.\n- Folding results in layers of rock being moved away from each other.\n## Why are fossils important?\n- Fossils allow us to determine early biodiversity\n- Fossils can be compared to modern day organisms\n- Fossils improve our understanding of previous conditions on Earth\n- Fossils support our estimates for the age of the Earth\n- Fossils provide evidence for Evolution\n- Fossils provide evidence of continental drift\n## Mitosis\n- Mitosis is the process by which one parent cell splits into two identical daughter cells.\n- Mitosis is the most common method of reproduction for single-celled organisms.\n- There are 5 main stages of mitosis:\n1. Prophase: number of chromosomes in the cell double up\n2. Metaphase: chromosomes wind up and align along the equator of the cells\n3. Anaphase: Chromatids (Not Chromosomes, this is explained later) are drawn towards the ends of the cell by spindle fibers\n4. Telophase: Cell nuclei forms, chromosomes form and unwind\n5. Cytokinesis: Cell splits into two, completing the process of mitosis\n- In the human body, all cells other than sex cells (sperm and ova) are generated through mitosis.\n## DNA\n- DNA stands for DeoxyriboNucleic Acid\n- DNA takes the shape of a Double Helix\n\n<img src=\"https://www.genome.gov/sites/default/files/tg/en/illustration/double_helix.jpg\" alt=\"DNA double helix\" style=\"float:right;\" width=20%>\n\n- The DNA molecule is made up of repeating components known as NUCLEOTIDES\n- Each nucleotide has three components:\n  - A sugar\n  - A Phosphate\n  - One of four nitrogenous bases:\n    - A - Ademine\n    - T - Thymine\n    - G - Guanine\n    - C - Cytocine\n- Adenine (A) can only pair with Thymine (T), while Guanine (G) can only pair with Cytocine (C)\n- DNA contains all the instructions to make POLYPEPTIDES (Proteins)\n- The nitrogenous bases bond with each other via hydrogen bonds\n- DNA is read in groups of three, known as CODONS or TRIPLETS\n## Mutations\n<blockquote>A MUTATION is the alteration of the nucleotide sequence in the genome of an organism</blockquote>\n<blockquote>A MUTAGEN is a physical or chemical agent that changes the genetic material (Usually DNA) of an organism, increasing the frequency of </blockquote>\n\n- Most mutations are harmless (neutral)\n- Mutations that IMPROVE survivability are known as BENEFICIAL MUTATIONS\n- Mutations that DECREASE survivability are known as DETRIMENTAL MUTATIONS\n## Punnett Squares\n- Chromosomes contain genes, which dictate traits\n- An Allele is any of the possible forms of a gene, e.g. Tall/short\n- Alleles tend to be either Dominant or Recessive. Dominant alleles are represented by a capital letter, while recessive alleles are represented by the same letter, but lower case.\n- Every chromosome pairs up with another chromosome. The alleles in each pair of chromosomes dictates the properties of the organism. One chromosome is inherited from the organism's male parent, while the other is inherited from the female parent.\n- When an organism has a pair of Homozygous Alleles, both chromosomes for that trait have the same allele (Both Dominant or both recessive)\n- When an organism has Heterozygous Alleles, one chromosome has the Dominant allele, while the other has the recessive allele. An organism with Heterozygous Alleles will display the characteristics of the Dominant Allele.\n![Image of a Punnett Square](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/22/Punnett_Square.svg)\n- A Punnett square is a graphical representation of the chances of an organism having a specific trait.\n- In the image above, yellow coloring is the dominant allele, while green coloring is the recessive allele.\n- The yellow parent in the image is Heterozygous for the color trait, while the green parent is Homozygous Recessive for the color trait.\n- The chart shows that there is a 50% chance of a heterozygous plant, and a 50% chance of a homozygous recessive plant.\n- Punnett squares can be used for many visible traits (handedness, curly/straight hair, ability to roll tongue, detached earlobes), while other traits, such as some genetic diseases, require more in-depth methods.\n## Pedigree Charts\n- A pedigree chart is a diagram that shows the occurence and appearance of phenotypes of a particular gene from one generation to the next.\n![Image of a pedigree chart](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9c/Pedigree-chart-example.svg/769px-Pedigree-chart-example.svg.png)\n- Pedigree charts can be used to find the presence or absence of traits in a bloodline (e.g. CCR-5:Δ32 HIV Immunity)\n","source":"_posts/biology-year-10.md","raw":"---\ntitle: \"Science - Biology Year 10\"\ndate: 2019-10-19T20:17:29+10:00\ndraft: false\ndiscussionId: biology-year-10-1\ncategories:\n  - Year 10\n  - Science\ntags:\n  - Biology\n  - Year 10\n  - Science\n  - Review\n---\n<details>\n<summary> Definitions </summary>\n\n- Chromosome: Structure in the nucleus of a cell, composed of DNA\n- DNA: A double helix structure made of nucleotides\n- Deoxyribose sugar: one of the three nucleotides of DNA\n- Gene: a section of DNA that carries the code for a particular characteristic\n- Nitrogenous base: part of a nucleotide, four types: ademine, thymine, guanine and cytocine\n- Nucleotide: the building blocks of DNA, composed of a Deoxyribose sugar, Nitrogenous base and phosphate\n- Phosphate: one of the components of a nucleotide\n- Trait: a characteristic inherited by an organism\n- Autosome: all chromosomes other than sex chromosomes\n- Centromere: point where the two chromatids join together\n- Chromatid: one of the strands of a chromosome following replication\n- Diploid Number: number of chromosomes in the cell of an organism, represented as \\\\(2N\\\\). \\\\(2N=46\\\\) in humans\n- Gamete: sperm or egg cell\n- Haploid Number: number of chromosomes in the gametes of an organism, represented as \\\\(N\\\\). \\\\(N=23\\\\) in humans\n- Homologous Chromosomes: chromosomes with genes for particular characteristics at the same location\n- Meiosis: A type of cell division where gametes are produced\n- Mitosis: A type of cell division that produces two daughter cells which are identical to the parent cell\n- Allele: Different forms of the same gene located at the same point of homologous chromosomes\n- Dominant Allele: allele for a trait that is observed in the outward appearance when the trait is heterozygous\n- Genotype: genetic information carried by an individual\n- Heterozygous: having two different alleles on homologous chromosomes\n- Homozygous: having two identical alleles on homologous chromosomes\n- Mutation: the alteration of the nucleotide sequence in the genome of an organism\n- Phenotype: observable characteristic dictated by the genotype\n- Recessive Allele: allele for a trait that is hidden in the outward appearance when the trait is heterozygous\n- Genome: genetic information carried by a haploid set of chromosomes\n- Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP): difference of only one base pair between two organisms\n</details>\n\n## Fossils\n* A fossil is evidence of past life.\n* Fossils can be part of an organism, such as its bones, teeth, feathers, scales, branches or leaves.\n* Fossils can also be traces, such as footprints, burrows and other evidence that an organism existed in an area.\n* Fossils provide evidence that life has changed over time.

This only applies to UNDISTURBED rock.\n- Relative age: age of the fossil based on the Law of Superposition, e.g. Fossil A is older than Fossil B but younger than fossil C.\n- Absolute age: the actual age of the fossil, e.g. Fossil A is 6000 years old.\n## Analysing the Fossil record\n- Faulting can cause projections of rock through other layers.\n- Folding results in layers of rock being moved away from each other.\n## Why are fossils important?\n- Fossils allow us to determine early biodiversity\n- Fossils can be compared to modern day organisms\n- Fossils improve our understanding of previous conditions on Earth\n- Fossils support our estimates for the age of the Earth\n- Fossils provide evidence for Evolution\n- Fossils provide evidence of continental drift\n## Mitosis\n- Mitosis is the process by which one parent cell splits into two identical daughter cells.\n- Mitosis is the most common method of reproduction for single-celled organisms.\n- There are 5 main stages of mitosis:\n1. Prophase: number of chromosomes in the cell double up\n2. Metaphase: chromosomes wind up and align along the equator of the cells\n3. Anaphase: Chromatids (Not Chromosomes, this is explained later) are drawn towards the ends of the cell by spindle fibers\n4. Telophase: Cell nuclei forms, chromosomes form and unwind\n5. Cytokinesis: Cell splits into two, completing the process of mitosis\n- In the human body, all cells other than sex cells (sperm and ova) are generated through mitosis.\n## DNA\n- DNA stands for DeoxyriboNucleic Acid\n- DNA takes the shape of a Double Helix\n\n<img src=\"https://www.genome.gov/sites/default/files/tg/en/illustration/double_helix.jpg\" alt=\"DNA double helix\" style=\"float:right;\" width=20%>\n\n- The DNA molecule is made up of repeating components known as NUCLEOTIDES\n- Each nucleotide has three components:\n  - A sugar\n  - A Phosphate\n  - One of four nitrogenous bases:\n    - A - Ademine\n    - T - Thymine\n    - G - Guanine\n    - C - Cytocine\n- Adenine (A) can only pair with Thymine (T), while Guanine (G) can only pair with Cytocine (C)\n- DNA contains all the instructions to make POLYPEPTIDES (Proteins)\n- The nitrogenous bases bond with each other via hydrogen bonds\n- DNA is read in groups of three, known as CODONS or TRIPLETS\n## Mutations\n<blockquote>A MUTATION is the alteration of the nucleotide sequence in the genome of an organism</blockquote>\n<blockquote>A MUTAGEN is a physical or chemical agent that changes the genetic material (Usually DNA) of an organism, increasing the frequency of </blockquote>\n\n- Most mutations are harmless (neutral)\n- Mutations that IMPROVE survivability are known as BENEFICIAL MUTATIONS\n- Mutations that DECREASE survivability are known as DETRIMENTAL MUTATIONS\n## Punnett Squares\n- Chromosomes contain genes, which dictate traits\n- An Allele is any of the possible forms of a gene, e.g. Tall/short\n- Alleles tend to be either Dominant or Recessive. Dominant alleles are represented by a capital letter, while recessive alleles are represented by the same letter, but lower case.\n- Every chromosome pairs up with another chromosome. The alleles in each pair of chromosomes dictates the properties of the organism. One chromosome is inherited from the organism's male parent, while the other is inherited from the female parent.\n- When an organism has a pair of Homozygous Alleles, both chromosomes for that trait have the same allele (Both Dominant or both recessive)\n- When an organism has Heterozygous Alleles, one chromosome has the Dominant allele, while the other has the recessive allele. An organism with Heterozygous Alleles will display the characteristics of the Dominant Allele.\n![Image of a Punnett Square](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/22/Punnett_Square.svg)\n- A Punnett square is a graphical representation of the chances of an organism having a specific trait.\n- In the image above, yellow coloring is the dominant allele, while green coloring is the recessive allele.\n- The yellow parent in the image is Heterozygous for the color trait, while the green parent is Homozygous Recessive for the color trait.\n- The chart shows that there is a 50% chance of a heterozygous plant, and a 50% chance of a homozygous recessive plant.\n- Punnett squares can be used for many visible traits (handedness, curly/straight hair, ability to roll tongue, detached earlobes), while other traits, such as some genetic diseases, require more in-depth methods.\n## Pedigree Charts\n- A pedigree chart is a diagram that shows the occurence and appearance of phenotypes of a particular gene from one generation to the next.\n![Image of a pedigree chart](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9c/Pedigree-chart-example.svg/769px-Pedigree-chart-example.svg.png)\n- Pedigree charts can be used to find the presence or absence of traits in a bloodline (e.g. CCR-5:Δ32 HIV Immunity)\n","slug":"biology-year-10","published":1,"updated":"2019-11-20T04:42:56.408Z","comments":1,"layout":"post","photos":[],"link":"","_id":"ck3f7y7tk0004izvc2n8w1x51","content":"<details>\n<summary> Definitions </summary>\n<ul>\n<li>Chromosome: Structure in the nucleus of a cell, composed of DNA</li>\n<li>DNA: A double helix structure made of nucleotides</li>\n<li>Deoxyribose sugar: one of the three nucleotides of DNA</li>\n<li>Gene: a section of DNA that carries the code for a particular characteristic</li>\n<li>Nitrogenous base: part of a nucleotide, four types: ademine, thymine, guanine and cytocine</li>\n<li>Nucleotide: the building blocks of DNA, composed of a Deoxyribose sugar, Nitrogenous base and phosphate</li>\n<li>Phosphate: one of the components of a nucleotide</li>\n<li>Trait: a characteristic inherited by an organism</li>\n<li>Autosome: all chromosomes other than sex chromosomes</li>\n<li>Centromere: point where the two chromatids join together</li>\n<li>Chromatid: one of the strands of a chromosome following replication</li>\n<li>Diploid Number: number of chromosomes in the cell of an organism, represented as \\(2N\\). \\(2N=46\\) in humans</li>\n<li>Gamete: sperm or egg cell</li>\n<li>Haploid Number: number of chromosomes in the gametes of an organism, represented as \\(N\\). \\(N=23\\) in humans</li>\n<li>Homologous Chromosomes: chromosomes with genes for particular characteristics at the same location</li>\n<li>Meiosis: A type of cell division where gametes are produced</li>\n<li>Mitosis: A type of cell division that produces two daughter cells which are identical to the parent cell</li>\n<li>Allele: Different forms of the same gene located at the same point of homologous chromosomes</li>\n<li>Dominant Allele: allele for a trait that is observed in the outward appearance when the trait is heterozygous</li>\n<li>Genotype: genetic information carried by an individual</li>\n<li>Heterozygous: having two different alleles on homologous chromosomes</li>\n<li>Homozygous: having two identical alleles on homologous chromosomes</li>\n<li>Mutation: the alteration of the nucleotide sequence in the genome of an organism</li>\n<li>Phenotype: observable characteristic dictated by the genotype</li>\n<li>Recessive Allele: allele for a trait that is hidden in the outward appearance when the trait is heterozygous</li>\n<li>Genome: genetic information carried by a haploid set of chromosomes</li>\n<li>Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP): difference of only one base pair between two organisms</li>\n</ul>\n</details>\n<h2>Fossils</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>A fossil is evidence of past life.</li>\n<li>Fossils can be part of an organism, such as its bones, teeth, feathers, scales, branches or leaves.</li>\n<li>Fossils can also be traces, such as footprints, burrows and other evidence that an organism existed in an area.</li>\n<li>Fossils provide evidence that life has changed over time.

fundamental concept that underpins all aspects of\n    Aboriginal spirituality\n-   The Dreaming refers to Aboriginal spiritual beliefs about creation and\n    existence\n-   According to Aboriginal spirituality, all life is part of a larger network\n    that can be traced back to the ANCESTOR BEINGS of the Dreaming\n-   The Dreaming involves all knowledge and understanding in Aboriginal\n    societies\n-   The Dreaming incorporates an explanation for the origins of the Universe\n-   *The Dreaming is INEXTRICABLY CONNECTED TO THE LAND* as the Land is the\n    physical medium through which

future as a complete and present reality\n-   The Dreaming is embedded in all aspects of Aboriginal life, because every\n    part of Aboriginal life is derived from the Dreaming\n### Kinship\n-   Kinship identify a system of belonging and responsibilities within a clan\n-   Kinship is not only based on family, but also one’s totem, usually a plant\n    or an animal, which represent a person’s or group’s connection with the\n    Ancestor Spirits\n-   Kinship ties govern all interactions with other people (such as who you can\n    marry, who you can talk to, etc.), as well as responsibilities (such as\n    educating younger generations, etc.)\n### Art\n-   Art is a very important method of communicating the Dreaming because it\n    illustrates the actions of the Ancestor

Spirits\n### Stories\n-   Stories from the Dreaming describe Aboriginal Law and Lifestyle\n-   The Dreaming is often described through stories which dictate the Ancestor\n    Spirits moved through the land, creating features that are visible today\n-   These stories provide a foundation and explanation of various aspects of\n    Aboriginal tradition and law by explaining the creation of the Natural World\n    and how the Dreaming shapes the day-to-day life of people and animals\n-   Learning the Dreaming stories is a lifelong process, and is important for\n    teaching Aboriginal people the moral conduct of their people and of society\n### Rituals\n-   Rituals from the Dreaming relive the actions of the Ancestor Spirits\n-   Derived from important aspects of the Dreaming\n-   Important because they are understood as reliving an event in the present\n    moment\n-   Ancestor Beings are “made present” through the people, objects, words, and\n    movements used during the ritual\n    -   Example: The Smoking Ceremony, in which smoke is used to cleanse and\n        heal. The ritual is performed symbolically at public events, but also\n        during other traditional uses such as smoking ceremonies\n-   Totems carry ceremonial responsibilities known as balance rites\n    -

is electrostatically charged\n- Cation: Positively Charged ion\n- Anion: Negatively Charged ion\n- Valence shell: Outermost electron shell\n- Octet: 8 electrons in the valence shell (2 if the element is Hydrogen or Helium)\n- Catalyst: something that causes and/or speeds up chemical reactions\n- Proton: positively charged hadron\n- Neutron: neutral hadron\n- Electron: negatively charged lepton\n- exothermic: emits heat\n- endothermic: absorbs heat\n- Atomic number: number of protons\n- Atomic mass: number of protons + number of neutrons\n- Neutralisation: mixing an acid and a base to create water\n- Corrosion: a gas or liquid chemically attacking an exposed surface\n- Combustion: exothermic reaction between a fuel and oxidiser, which produces heat, light and gaseous products\n- decomposition: when a single compound breaks down into two or more compounds\n- oxidisation: corrosion reaction where the gas/liquid is Oxygen (O)\n- Precipitation: formation of an insoluble solid when two soluble solutions are combined (product is known as a precipitate)\n- Acid-Metal reaction: when an acid and metal react to produce a metallic salt and Hydrogen\n\n</details>\n\n## Periodic Table\n- The periodic table is a table listing the fundamental building blocks of the universe: elements\n- NOTE: ATOM and ELEMENT do NOT mean the same thing!\n  - An atom is a particle containing protons and electrons (and generally neutrons too)\n  - An element is a substance made out of the SAME TYPE OF ATOM\n  - An atom is the smallest sample of an element.\n- Atoms have a nucleus (which contains their protons and neutrons) and orbiting shells (which contain electrons in fixed rings)\n- Electron shells fill from the innermost available space:\n  - The first shell can hold a MAXIMUM of 2 electrons\n  - The second shell can hold a maximum of 8 electrons\n  - The third shell can hold 8 electrons until the fourth shell has 2 electrons, then another 10 (total of 18)\n<details>\n<summary>    This concept is a bit confusing at first. Click here to see how it works </summary>\n      - In the fourth period, Potassium has an electron configuration of Potassium is  $ 2,8,8,1 $\n      - Calcium is  $ 2,8,8,2 $\n      - Scandium is  $ 2,8,9,2 $ .

These tend to come from their Latin names (\"Aurum\" in the case of Gold)\n- Another way is by writing out the ELECTRON CONFIGURATION.\n  - This is the filling order of the electron shells.\n  - For example, Hydrogen is  $ 1 $ , Oxygen is  $ 2,6 $ , etc.\n  - This method is not often used for naming an element, since electron configurations can change in Chemical Reactions.\n\n## Chemical Reactions\n- A chemical reaction is when the bonds between atoms are broken, formed or changed\n- A chemical reaction has 2 parts: reactants and products\n  - Reactants are the substances BEFORE the reaction\n  - Products are the substances AFTER the reaction\n### Law Of Conservation Of Mass\n- The Law of Conservation of Mass states that:\n<blockquote>Matter cannot be created nor destroyed, it can only be changed from one form to another.</blockquote>\n- This means that in a chemical reaction, the total mass of the products MUST be the same as the total mass of the reactants.\n- For example, photosynthesis:\n  - 6CO2 + 6H2O —> C6H12O6 + 6O2\n  - On both sides of the equation, there are:\n    - 6 Carbon atoms\n    - 6 Oxygen atoms\n    - 12 Hydrogen atoms\n  - This is known as a BALANCED EQUATION\n### Law of Constant Proportions\n- The Law of Constant Proportions states that:\n- <blockquote>A given chemical compound always contains its components in a fixed ratio.</blockquote>\n\n- For example, in water, there will ALWAYS be two hydrogen atoms for every oxygen atom (H2O).\n  - If there were an equal number of hydrogen and oxygen atoms, then the substance would not be Water (H2O), instead it would be Hydrogen Peroxide (H2O2).\n### Exothermic and Endothermic Reactions\n- An EXOTHERMIC REACTION is a reaction that GENERATES heat/energy (exo-: outside, -thermic: heat)\n- An ENDOTHERMIC REACTION is a reaction that REQUIRES heat/energy (endo-: inside, -thermic: heat)\n- Sometimes, exothermic reactions require heat to start. However, their total energy output is GREATER than the total energy input\n### Ionic and Covalent Bonds\n- An IONIC bond is a bond between oppositely charged IONS (atoms with an unequal number of protons and electrons)\n- Ionic bonds occur between a metal and a non-metal\n- One atom will LOSE electrons, and the other will GAIN electrons so that both have a filled outer shell.\n- For example, in  $ NaCl $ , The Sodium atom loses an electron and the Chlorine atom gains that electron. The two atoms are then electrostatically attracted together.\n- A COVALENT bond is a bond where two non-metal atoms SHARE a pair of valence electrons\n- An atom can have multiple covalent bonds. For example, carbon group atoms can have up to four covalent bonds\n- Noble Gases (group 18) do NOT form bonds with anything (except in rare circumstances)\n- Two atoms with a covalent bond can be said to be DIATOMIC\n\n## VIDEO TUTORIAL: Lewis-Dot Diagrams (<8 minutes)\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/cIuXl7o6mAw\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n### Element Groupings\n- The periodic table has several methods of being divided into categories.\n- The first method is by PERIOD\n  - Elements in horizontal rows are in the same period.\n  - Each at the end of each period, the next electron shell begins to fill.\n- The second method is by BLOCK\n  - Each block of the periodic table is determined by the electron orbitals which are filled in that block.\n  - Each block is named after the orbital which gets filled in that block\n![Image of the periodic table grouped by block](https://www.thoughtco.com/thmb/4QQYiqawXiYyXmWWmORUW5T_zQI=/690x391/filters:fill(auto,1)/ecblocks-56a129535f9b58b7d0bc9f2e.jpg)\n  - The s-block is everything in columns 1 and 2, as well as Helium\n  - The d-block is everything from column 3 to 12, except the Lanthanides and Actinides\n  - The p-block is everything from column 13 onwards, except Helium\n  - The f-block is the Lanthanides and Actinides\n- The third method is by GROUP\n  - Vertical columns of the Periodic Table are known as GROUPS\n  - Elements in the same group have similar properties\n    - Group 1: Alkaline Metals\n    - Group 2: Alkaline Earth Metals\n    - Group 3-12: Transition Metals\n    - Group 13: Boron Group\n    - Group 14: Carbon Group\n    - Group 15: Pnictogens\n    - Group 16: Chalcogens\n    - Group 17: Halogens\n    - Group 18: Noble Gases\n</p><hr>\nPost Author: [Pranav Sharma](mailto:rbxii3@rbxii3.com)\n","source":"_posts/chemistry-year-10.md","raw":"---\ntitle: \"Science: Chemistry Year 10\"\ndate: 2019-10-18T09:59:06+11:00\ndraft: false\nDiscussionId: chem-year-10-1\ncategories:\n  - Year 10\n  - Science\ntags:\n  - Chemistry\n  - Year 10\n  - Science\n  - Review\n---\n<script data-ad-client=\"ca-pub-4283941482669066\" async src=\"https://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js\"></script>\n<details>\n<summary> Definitions </summary>\n\n- Ion: An atom which is electrostatically charged\n- Cation: Positively Charged ion\n- Anion: Negatively Charged ion\n- Valence shell: Outermost electron shell\n- Octet: 8 electrons in the valence shell (2 if the element is Hydrogen or Helium)\n- Catalyst: something that causes and/or speeds up chemical reactions\n- Proton: positively charged hadron\n- Neutron: neutral hadron\n- Electron: negatively charged lepton\n- exothermic: emits heat\n- endothermic: absorbs heat\n- Atomic number: number of protons\n- Atomic mass: number of protons + number of neutrons\n- Neutralisation: mixing an acid and a base to create water\n- Corrosion: a gas or liquid chemically attacking an exposed surface\n- Combustion: exothermic reaction between a fuel and oxidiser, which produces heat, light and gaseous products\n- decomposition: when a single compound breaks down into two or more compounds\n- oxidisation: corrosion reaction where the gas/liquid is Oxygen (O)\n- Precipitation: formation of an insoluble solid when two soluble solutions are combined (product is known as a precipitate)\n- Acid-Metal reaction: when an acid and metal react to produce a metallic salt and Hydrogen\n\n</details>\n\n## Periodic Table\n- The periodic table is a table listing the fundamental building blocks of the universe: elements\n- NOTE: ATOM and ELEMENT do NOT mean the same thing!\n  - An atom is a particle containing protons and electrons (and generally neutrons too)\n  - An element is a substance made out of the SAME TYPE OF ATOM\n  - An atom is the smallest sample of an element.\n- Atoms have a nucleus (which contains their protons and neutrons) and orbiting shells (which contain electrons in fixed rings)\n- Electron shells fill from the innermost available space:\n  - The first shell can hold a MAXIMUM of 2 electrons\n  - The second shell can hold a maximum of 8 electrons\n  - The third shell can hold 8 electrons until the fourth shell has 2 electrons, then another 10 (total of 18)\n<details>\n<summary>    This concept is a bit confusing at first.

These tend to come from their Latin names (“Aurum” in the case of Gold)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Another way is by writing out the ELECTRON CONFIGURATION.\n<ul>\n<li>This is the filling order of the electron shells.</li>\n<li>For example, Hydrogen is  $ 1 $ , Oxygen is  $ 2,6 $ , etc.</li>\n<li>This method is not often used for naming an element, since electron configurations can change in Chemical Reactions.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Chemical Reactions</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>A chemical reaction is when the bonds between atoms are broken, formed or changed</li>\n<li>A chemical reaction has 2 parts: reactants and products\n<ul>\n<li>Reactants are the substances BEFORE the reaction</li>\n<li>Products are the substances AFTER the reaction</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Law Of Conservation Of Mass</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>The Law of Conservation of Mass states that:</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>Matter cannot be created nor destroyed, it can only be changed from one form to another.</blockquote>\n- This means that in a chemical reaction, the total mass of the products MUST be the same as the total mass of the reactants.\n- For example, photosynthesis:\n  - 6CO2 + 6H2O —> C6H12O6 + 6O2\n  - On both sides of the equation, there are:\n    - 6 Carbon atoms\n    - 6 Oxygen atoms\n    - 12 Hydrogen atoms\n  - This is known as a BALANCED EQUATION\n### Law of Constant Proportions\n- The Law of Constant Proportions states that:\n- <blockquote>A given chemical compound always contains its components in a fixed ratio.</blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>For example, in water, there will ALWAYS be two hydrogen atoms for every oxygen atom (H2O).\n<ul>\n<li>If there were an equal number of hydrogen and oxygen atoms, then the substance would not be Water (H2O), instead it would be Hydrogen Peroxide (H2O2).</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Exothermic and Endothermic Reactions</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>An EXOTHERMIC REACTION is a reaction that GENERATES heat/energy (exo-: outside, -thermic: heat)</li>\n<li>An ENDOTHERMIC REACTION is a reaction that REQUIRES heat/energy (endo-: inside, -thermic: heat)</li>\n<li>Sometimes, exothermic reactions require heat to start. However, their total energy output is GREATER than the total energy input</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Ionic and Covalent Bonds</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>An IONIC bond is a bond between oppositely charged IONS (atoms with an unequal number of protons and electrons)</li>\n<li>Ionic bonds occur between a metal and a non-metal</li>\n<li>One atom will LOSE electrons, and the other will GAIN electrons so that both have a filled outer shell.</li>\n<li>For example, in  $ NaCl $ , The Sodium atom loses an electron and the Chlorine atom gains that electron. The two atoms are then electrostatically attracted together.</li>\n<li>A COVALENT bond is a bond where two non-metal atoms SHARE a pair of valence electrons</li>\n<li>An atom can have multiple covalent bonds. For example, carbon group atoms can have up to four covalent bonds</li>\n<li>Noble Gases (group 18) do NOT form bonds with anything (except in rare circumstances)</li>\n<li>Two atoms with a covalent bond can be said to be DIATOMIC</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>VIDEO TUTORIAL: Lewis-Dot Diagrams (&lt;8 minutes)</h2>\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/cIuXl7o6mAw\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n<h3>Element Groupings</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>The periodic table has several methods of being divided into categories.</li>\n<li>The first method is by PERIOD\n<ul>\n<li>Elements in horizontal rows are in the same period.</li>\n<li>Each at the end of each period, the next electron shell begins to fill.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>The second method is by BLOCK\n<ul>\n<li>Each block of the periodic table is determined by the electron orbitals which are filled in that block.</li>\n<li>Each block is named after the orbital which gets filled in that block<br>\n<img src=\"https://www.thoughtco.com/thmb/4QQYiqawXiYyXmWWmORUW5T_zQI=/690x391/filters:fill(auto,1)/ecblocks-56a129535f9b58b7d0bc9f2e.jpg\" alt=\"Image of the periodic table grouped by block\"></li>\n<li>The s-block is everything in columns 1 and 2, as well as Helium</li>\n<li>The d-block is everything from column 3 to 12, except the Lanthanides and Actinides</li>\n<li>The p-block is everything from column 13 onwards, except Helium</li>\n<li>The f-block is the Lanthanides and Actinides</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>The third method is by GROUP\n<ul>\n<li>Vertical columns of the Periodic Table are known as GROUPS</li>\n<li>Elements in the same group have similar properties\n<ul>\n<li>Group 1: Alkaline Metals</li>\n<li>Group 2: Alkaline Earth Metals</li>\n<li>Group 3-12: Transition Metals</li>\n<li>Group 13: Boron Group</li>\n<li>Group 14: Carbon Group</li>\n<li>Group 15: Pnictogens</li>\n<li>Group 16: Chalcogens</li>\n<li>Group 17: Halogens</li>\n<li>Group 18: Noble Gases</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</p><hr>\nPost Author: [Pranav Sharma](mailto:rbxii3@rbxii3.com)\n"},{"title":"Contributing","date":"2017-08-01T15:38:32.000Z","draft":false,"exclude_search":true,"discussionId":"Contributing1","_content":"## Post Submissions:\n- [Input Form](/posts/newpost/)\n- [Upload A File](/posts/uploads/)\n## How to contribute:\n- Format your notes using [This guide](/posts/writing-guide/) in a text document/Google Doc and email the link to [md.schoolnotes@rbxii3.net](mailto:md.schoolnotes@rbxii3.net).

The absolute reference frame for the direction is the origin of the object.\n- Position is measured in metres.\n### Distance Travelled\n- Distance Travelled describes how far a body travels during a journey.\n- Distance is a scalar quantity and is measured in meters.\n\n## Displacement-Time Graphs\n- Displacement-time graphs can be used to summarise the motion of an object\n- The gradient of the graph at any point is the velocity at that point\n![Displacement Time graph example](https://cdn1.byjus.com/physics/2017/10/07053000/Distance-Time-Graph2.png)\n","slug":"kinematics","published":1,"updated":"2019-11-20T04:42:56.411Z","comments":1,"layout":"post","photos":[],"link":"","_id":"ck3f7y7up001bizvc7p6b1vi5","content":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" id=\"MathJax-script\" async\n  src=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/mathjax@3/es5/tex-mml-chtml.js\">\n</script>\n<h2>Motion</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Motion is a fundamental observable phenomenon.</li>\n<li>The study of Kinematics involves describing, measuring, and analysing motion without considering the forces and masses involved.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Scalars and Vectors</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Scalars are physical quantities that can be described as a magnitude, with a unit (for example, 60km/h)\n<ul>\n<li>Examples of Scalars include time, distance, volume, and speed</li>\n<li>Scalars are represented by a simple italic symbol, such as <em>t</em> for time or <em>d</em> for distance</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Vectors are physical quantities that can be described as a magnitude, a unit and a direction (for example, 20m West)\n<ul>\n<li>Examples of Vectors include position, displacement, velocity, acceleration, and force</li>\n<li>Vectors are represented using VECTOR NOTATION.\n<ul>\n<li>The most common type of vector notation uses an arrow above the symbol, for example \\(\\vec{v}\\) for Velocity</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Adding and Subtracting Vectors Using Algebra (One Dimension)</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>When adding or subtracting vectors using algebra, a sign convention must be established to represent the direction\n<ul>\n<li>For example, positive for forwards and negative for backwards</li>\n<li>When using a sign convention it is CRUCIAL to provide a key explaining the convention used.</li>\n<li>Using a sign convention allows you to enter the directions and magnitudes into your calculator.

Christianity","date":"2019-09-18T22:57:06.000Z","draft":false,"DiscussionId":"principal-beliefs-christianity-1","_content":"## Divinity and Humanity of Jesus Christ\n- Divine: of or pertaining to God\n- Jesus is 100% divine, God incarnate (made flesh)\n- Human: of of pertaining to the nature of people\n- Jesus is 100% Human\n- Jesus being both 100% divine and 100% human is known as \"Hypostatic Union\"\n- Jesus is the Word of God made flesh (John 1:1, John 1:14)\n- His divinity is evident through the Gospel testimonies of the miracles and healings performed by Jesus\n- His humanity is evident through his life as a carpenter and his suffering on the Cross\n### Council of Nicaea - 325CE\n- Early Christian thinkers argued over Jesus’ dual nature, and found it difficult to explain how and why God ‘was a man’.\n- Disputes arose over the many competing explanations, such as:\n  - Docetism: is a position which undermines the integrity of the humanity of Jesus because it claims that Jesus is fully divine but not truly human, because he is God merely adopting the appearance of being human.\n  - Arianism: is the belief that Jesus is superior to the rest of creation but not equal to God because Jesus was created by God and thus is not eternal unlike God.\n  - Nestorianism: Nestorius undermined the unity of Jesus by claiming that Mary was the Mother of the human Jesus but not the divine Jesus, to suggest that there were two persons within Jesus\n- The Council of Nicaea produced the Nicene Creed, which states that the Father and the Son are of one essence and hence Jesus is fully divine.\n- The Council of Nicaea also canonized (made the concept legitimate) the Holy Trinity\n- This decision was reaffirmed by the Council of Constantinople\n\n## The Nature of God and Trinity\n- Christians believe that God is:\n  - Transcendant\n  - Immanent\n  - Omnipotent\n  - Omniscient\n  - Omnipresent\n  - Eternal\n- Christians believe that God is One and the Creator of all things\n  - One being existing in three distinct persons: the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit (Holy Trinity)\n  - Each person is distinct but not isolated from one another\n  - Concept of the Trinity was canonized at the Council of Nicaea\n  - The divine power is common to all three, but they are distinct people/beings\n\n## Death and Resurrection\n- Jesus was crucified\n- Resurrected 3 days later\n- Passion of Christ: Events from Jesus' arrest until his death\n- The belief is that Jesus' death was important to destroy sin and give humanity the opportunity for eternal life (Romans 8:3-4)\n- Christians believe God has revealed himself in creation through:\n  - The teachings and writings of the Prophets\n  - The Holy Spirit\n  - In the person, life and teachings of Jesus Christ\n- Christians believe that the Resurrection of the Body will occur for all at the Final Judgement\n\n## Revelation\n- The notion that God is intimately involved with all aspects of human life\n  - Thus God is revealed to humankind in and through the experiences of human history\n- God is the ONLY source of Revelation\n- He has revealed himself through:\n  - Creation\n  - Writings of Prophets\n  - Jesus\n  - The Holy Spirit\n-  Further communicated through:\n  -  The Bible\n  -  The teaching traditions of the Church (Inspired by the Holy Spirit)\n  -  God's spirit that dwells within human beings\n- Orthodox and Catholic denominations place a greater emphasis on the teaching authority of the Church, which is considered equal to the Bible in terms of importance\n### Bible

who saves\n  - His saving action has particular concern/preference for those who are vulnerable in society\n  - Christians are called to accept the gift of God's saving action through their faith in Jesus and their own actions on behalf of those in need\n### Salvation Realised\n- Cannot be fully completed in this life → full realisation must be completed in the afterlife\n- Can be achieved through the acceptance of the life, death and resurrection of Jesus Christ\n- Humans can only achieve salvation with the grace of GOD\n- \"Born Again\" Christians believe that salvation is dependent on an individual's personal acceptance of Jesus\n- Other Christians believe that it is not only based on personal faith but also works of merit\n### Bible Passage References\n- [John

Religion And Beliefs in Australia post-1945","comments":1,"date":"2019-11-26T00:49:52.000Z","_content":"## Contemporary Aboriginal Spirituality\n### Aboriginal Spirituality as Determined by the Dreaming\n\n**Discuss how Aboriginal spirituality is determined by the Dreaming**\n\n_Kinship_\n\n\n\n*   The Dreaming – underpins all aspects of Aboriginal spirituality and traditional life\n*   Kinship – fabric of traditional Aboriginal society – everyone is related through the complex web of the Dreaming\n*   Totems:\n    *   Tribes are made up of clans, each descended from a spirit ancestor\n    *   Totem – a natural part of the region the clan originated from\n    *   Represents the ongoing life force of the Dreaming – are used at ceremonies\n    *   Unifies the clan under the spirit ancestor and creates a metaphysical connection with other clans bearing the same totem\n    *   Transcendent bond between humans and their totem as well as a Dreaming kinship with other individuals bearing the same totem\n*   Spirit ancestors:\n    *   Expect the members of these kinship groups to fulfil certain obligations\n    *   Required to obey tribal laws and beliefs and to subordinate individual interests to the greater good of the community\n    *   Reciprocal network of giving and receiving of right and obligations\n    *   Expect the knowledge will be passed down through the tribe\n    *   Require the kinship group to act as custodians of designated territory and totems\n\n_Ceremonial life_\n\n\n\n*   Aboriginal ceremonies always reaffirm the Dreaming\n*   Vital – event happened in the past – also believed to be happening in the present\n*   Usually recreate a moment of the Dreaming – allow participants to spiritually transform\n*   Obliged to take part – acknowledge the Dreaming events and show the ongoing metaphysical presence of the parallel Dreaming world\n*   Connected to spirituality as it is the expression of spirituality\n\n_Obligations to the land and people_\n\n\n\n*   Land, people and Dreaming- one symbiotic relationship –cannot exist without each other\n*   Comprise a complex system of reciprocal obligations and rights – contribute to the ongoing physical and spiritual wellbeing of each other\n*   Sacred duty to assist the land in ‘living’ to its potential – performance of ceremonies and rituals\n*   The land has certain obligations – provides the necessary tools for performing ceremonies e.g. body decorations derived from the natural landscape\n*   Inseparable and timeless connection with land – often regard land as mother\n\n\n### Issues for Aboriginal Spiritualties in Relation to: the effect of dispossession and the Land Rights movement\n\n**Discuss the continuing effect of dispossession on Aboriginal spiritualities in relation to:**\n\n\n\n*   Only make up 7.2% of Aus. population\n*   Lower life expectancy – males- 67, females- 72\n*   Higher incarceration rates – 20% prison population\n*   High unemployment rates – 20% of indigenous population\n*   5x avg. in drug induced mental disorders\n*   2x avg. schizophrenia\n*   2-3x avg. suicide\n*   Higher rates of homelessness – 9% of indigenous population\n\n_Separation from the land_\n\n\n\n*   _Terra Nullius_ – forced dispossession of Aboriginal people from the land\n*   Squatters denied access to waterholes, hunting grounds and sacred sites\n*   Private property \\\\(\\rightarrow\\\\) illegal to enter own ancestral territory – shot for doing so\n*   Imported stock e.g. cows trampled the earth and muddied water holes, introduction of pests e.g. rabbits damaged the sacred landscape\n*   Separation from Dreaming lands \\\\(\\rightarrow\\\\) lost spirituality and totemic identity\n*   Spiritual despair \\\\(\\rightarrow\\\\) slow self destruction still existing today\n*   Populations died out or dramatically declined- disease, malnutrition, alcohol dependence\n*   Managing to live in a manner that closely resembles the traditional ways\n*   Managing to integrate some traditional beliefs into more European way of life\n\n_Separation from kinship groups_\n\n\n\n*   Impossible to detach individuals from the wider community or the Dreaming family\n*   Dispossession of people from land \\\\(\\rightarrow\\\\) breakdown of the kinship system- isolated from ancestral territory and knowledge that had unified groups\n*   Forced to forfeit their places of totemic identity and extended spiritual family\n*   Decline of indigenous language – 350-750 distinct dialects \\\\(\\rightarrow\\\\) less than 150\n*   Many Dreaming stories and myths have died out\n*   Dispassion of land and kinship groups \\\\(\\rightarrow\\\\) breakdown in the authority of elders- rapidly hastening the separation of kinship groups\n*   Without access to dreaming kin – lost ability to fulfil spiritual obligations =\n*   Could no longer unite with Dreaming family in ceremonies and rites\n\n_The Stolen Generations_\n\n\n\n*   _Protection and Assimilation Act_ – Aboriginal children were forcibly removed from families\n*   Stated was for children’s welfare – attempt to ‘breed out’ Indigenous people\n*   Families were cut off from each other – taken great distances away, had names changed, backgrounds erased\n*   Cultural genocide\n*   Devastating for Aboriginal spirituality and the psyche of those involved\n*   3x higher infant mortality\n*   3x more likely to suffer lifestyle diseases\n*   6x higher unemployment rates\n*   Over representation in correctional facilities\n\n**Outline the important of the following for the Land Rights movement:**\n\n_Native Title_\n\n\n\n*   _Terra Nullius_ extinguished Native Title Acts under state and federal laws\n*   NT recognises the rights of Indigenous peoples in relation to the areas of land and water belonging to their particular ancestral tribes and the validity of Aboriginal territorial laws already existing prior to European settlement\n*   While not giving actual land ownership title to Indigenous peoples it allows some access to ancestral lands\n*   Facilitates use of land for spiritual and ceremonial etc\n*   Woodward Royal Commission – first gov’t inquiry to appreciate the crucial link between Aboriginal spirituality and the land\n*   _Racial Discrimination Act 1975_ –minority racial groups entitled to the same privileges and rights\n*   _Aboriginal Land Rights Act 1976_ – endorsed limited recognition of Indigenous people’s rights to the land\n*   _Native Title Act_ gave official recognition to the Indigenous way of life, particularly its spiritual connection with the land prior to European settlement\n\n_Mabo_\n\n\n\n*   **1982**: Mabo and a group of others took QLD gov’t to court, wanting legal recognition of their land as their families had lived there since ‘time immemorial’\n*   The deep spiritual significance was emphasised by the fact that Mabo repeatedly quoted stories and morals associated with his ancestral deity ‘Malo the Law Giver’\n*   Lost in the Supreme Court, took it to the High Court and Federal Parliament passed the _Native Title Act_\n\n_Wik_\n\n\n\n*   **1996**: The Wik people of Cape York brought a case to the High Court arguing their right to Native Title on local pastoral land\n*   High Court ruled in their favour and decided that Native Title rights and the rights of pastoral leaseholders could exist simultaneously\n*   **1998**: _Native Title Amendment Act_ – increased the power of the state gov’t over Native Title claims, reducing the rights of Aboriginals to negotiate directly with pastoral leaseholders\n*   **2006**: _Native Title Amendment Act_ – aims to make the Native Title process ‘more efficient’ and to hasten the processing of the active claims that are awaiting determination\n\n**Analyse the importance of the Dreaming for the Land Rights movement**\n\n\n\n*   Despite over 70% of Indigenous Australians claiming adherence to Christianity- has not diminished sense of ‘country’ and Dreaming connection to land\n*   Restored access to ancestral land that enabled the Dreaming to become dynamic reality once again\n*   Existence of Dreaming site and the possession of Dreaming knowledge forms the basis of Land Rights claims under the Land Rights and Native Title laws\n*   Demonstration of an ongoing affiliation with the land necessary for proof of entitlement – stories, songs, dances and sacred objects\n*   Difficulties with secret Dreaming sites – reluctant to reveal whereabouts to invasive scrutiny of the courts\n*   Issue – much of the evidence is based on oral tradition – can be dismissed as simple folklore or considered non objective and unreliable\n*   Dreaming legends may have adapted to incorporate Christian motifs and experiences\n\n\n\n\n## Religious Expression in Australia – 1945 to the present\n\n\n### The Religious Landscape from 1945 to the Present in Relation to: the changing patterns of religious adherence

reflected as 0.3% to 0.5% between 1933 to 1966\n*   More recent waves of Jewish migration to Aus. – almost 17% of Jewish population arrived after 1980\n*   1976 – Islam became present in Aus. 0.3%\n*   Between 1966 and 2006 Islamic population risen 69.4% due to immigration from Bosnia, Somalia and Ethiopia\n\n_Denominational switching_\n\n\n\n*   Many people are no longer making life long commitments to one church – more likely to go wherever they feel comfortable and well catered for\n*   Within Christian denominations – dramatic swing away from more liberal churches towards more conservative churches\n\n_Rise of New Age religions_\n\n\n\n*   Among the fastest growing faiths in the 2011 census increasing by 140% since 1996\n*   Differ from traditional faiths in that, while they form an overall spiritual movement they lack any unifying creed or doctrine\n*   Regardless, adherents tend to share some similar beliefs and practices\n*   Why?\n    *   A reaction against what is seen as a failure of Christianity and other mainstream religions to satisfactorily respond to the needs of people today\n    *   Concept of something well tried and yet new and different in important\n    *   Spread out due to the support of celebrities\n\n_Secularism_\n\n\n\n*   Any movement or concept, which rejects religious belief or adherence\n*   **1971**: ‘No Religion’ category included on census – explains rapid increase at the time\n*   Secular systems based on reason, fact and scientific analysis and therefore, differ from religious systems, which tend to be based on divine revelation and spiritual insight\n*   However, today there is less emphasis on conforming and more emphasis on the autonomy of the individual to determine what feels spiritually right to them\n*   Increased freedom – rise of secularism and the understanding that religion is essentially a private concern\n\n\n### Religious Dialogue in Multi-Faith Australia: ecumenical movements within Christianity, interfaith dialogue, the relationship between Aboriginal spiritualities and religious traditions in the process of Reconciliation\n\n**Describe the impact of Christian ecumenical movements in Australia**\n\n\n\n*   Ecumenism refers to the movement towards religious unity among Christian denominations\n*   Acknowledgement that unity in Christ outweighs the diversity in practice and beliefs in Christianity\n*   Developing opportunities to work, worship and dialogue together\n\nThe National Council of Churches Australia (NCCA)\n\n\n\n*   Formed 1994\n*   Grew from the previous Australian Council of Churches\n*   Comprised of 19 member churches representing the Catholic, Anglican, Orthodox and Protestant expressions of Christianity\n*   Works in partnership with state ecumenical councils and it operates through various commissions each which deals with a specific sphere of influence\n*   Faith and unity: week of prayer for Christian Unity\n*   Social justice network: annual social justice statements on pressing issues i.e. environment, peace, prisons etc\n\nNSW Ecumenical Council\n\n\n\n*   Fellowship of 14 Protestant and Orthodox churches in NSW and ACT\n*   Maintaining “the unity of the Spirit in the bonds of peace” Ephesians 4:3\n*   Being committed to the Gospel\n*   Proclaiming it together, and living out the implications of the Gospel for service in the world\n*   Taize Pilgrimage:\n    *   Hosted visits fro a brother from the Taize Community in France, as part of our churches’ common commitment to a spirituality of peace and reconciliation\n*   Peace and Justice Commission:\n    *   Works to enhance outcomes for asylum seekers \\\n\n\n**Evaluate the important of interfaith dialogue in multi-faith Australia**\n\n\n\n*   Formal discussion aimed towards developing greater mutual understanding between different religious traditions\n*   Allowing different religions to come to a better appreciation of the uniqueness of each other\n*   Education to dispel fear and bigotry\n*   Seeking opportunities to work together on key issues i.e. asylum seekers\n*   Allows religions to come to a better understanding of each other which increases tolerance e.g. education programs run of the ACCJ and State Bodies, Interfaith Iftar 2012 by Affinity Intercultural\n*   Promotes religion as having an important role, even in our increasingly secular Australian society\n*   Promotes shared prayer and spirituality in times of crisis i.e. the Port Arthur Massacre or the Bali Bombings\n*   Creates respect and appreciation for religious diversity which is essential for harmony and peace\n*   Has worked to break down the stereotypes and prejudice towards Muslims which has been overtly prevalent in Australia since 9/11 and the Cronulla Riots\n*   Can build relationships between different religions so they can more often and more effectively speak out on common issues and uphold shared values i.e. the dignity of the person, the sanctity of human life, care for those in need, justice and peace\n\n**Examine the relationship between Aboriginal spiritualities and religious traditions in the process of Reconciliation**\n\n\n\n*   Christian churches are now actively involved in promoting Aboriginal reconciliation, both at an individual and an ecumenical level\n*   Catholic Church is a strong supporter of Aboriginal reconciliation\n*   Church leaders have committed the Catholic community to addressing the injustice and disadvantage facing Aboriginal people\n*   Actively work in an advocacy role to dismantle or reform social structures, processes and institutions, which are a source of injustice and disadvantage to the Aboriginal community\n*   Position of the Anglican Church on Aboriginal reconciliation to similar to that of the Catholic Church – recognise the importance of Aboriginal spirituality\n*   1988: Anglican Church officially apologised for the hurt inflicted upon Aboriginal people and ten years later the General Synod formally apologised to the Stolen Generations\n*   Christian Churches work together to collectively assist the Aboriginal community to reclaim its spirituality\n*   Examples:\n    *   **National Reconciliation Week**: aims to give people across Australia, of all religions, the opportunity to focus on reconciliation\n    *   **Corroboree 2000**: hundred of thousands of people from across Australia joined to walk for reconciliation across the Sydney Harbour Bridge\n","source":"_posts/sor1-hsc-consolidation-1.md","raw":"---\ntitle:

Dreaming**\n\n_Kinship_\n\n\n\n*   The Dreaming – underpins all aspects of Aboriginal spirituality and traditional life\n*   Kinship – fabric of traditional Aboriginal society – everyone is related through the complex web of the Dreaming\n*   Totems:\n    *   Tribes are made up of clans, each descended from a spirit ancestor\n    *   Totem – a natural part of the region the clan originated from\n    *   Represents the ongoing life force of the Dreaming – are used at ceremonies\n    *   Unifies the clan under the spirit ancestor and creates a metaphysical connection with other clans bearing the same totem\n    *   Transcendent bond between humans and their totem as well as a Dreaming kinship with other individuals bearing the same totem\n*   Spirit ancestors:\n    *   Expect the members of these kinship groups to fulfil certain obligations\n    *   Required to obey tribal laws and beliefs and to subordinate individual interests to the greater good of the community\n    *   Reciprocal network of giving and receiving of right and obligations\n    *   Expect the knowledge will be passed down through the tribe\n    *   Require the kinship group to act as custodians of designated territory and totems\n\n_Ceremonial life_\n\n\n\n*   Aboriginal ceremonies always reaffirm the Dreaming\n*   Vital – event happened in the past – also believed to be happening in the present\n*   Usually recreate a moment of the Dreaming – allow participants to spiritually transform\n*   Obliged to take part – acknowledge the Dreaming events and show the ongoing metaphysical presence of the parallel Dreaming world\n*   Connected to spirituality as it is the expression of spirituality\n\n_Obligations to the land and people_\n\n\n\n*   Land, people and Dreaming- one symbiotic relationship –cannot exist without each other\n*   Comprise a complex system of reciprocal obligations and rights – contribute to the ongoing physical and spiritual wellbeing of each other\n*   Sacred duty to assist the land in ‘living’ to its potential – performance of ceremonies and rituals\n*   The land has certain obligations – provides the necessary tools for performing ceremonies e.g. body decorations derived from the natural landscape\n*   Inseparable and timeless connection with land – often regard land as mother\n\n\n### Issues for Aboriginal Spiritualties in Relation to: the effect of dispossession and the Land Rights movement\n\n**Discuss the continuing effect of dispossession on Aboriginal spiritualities in relation to:**\n\n\n\n*   Only make up 7.2% of Aus. population\n*   Lower life expectancy – males- 67, females- 72\n*   Higher incarceration rates – 20% prison population\n*   High unemployment rates – 20% of indigenous population\n*   5x avg. in drug induced mental disorders\n*   2x avg. schizophrenia\n*   2-3x avg. suicide\n*   Higher rates of homelessness – 9% of indigenous population\n\n_Separation from the land_\n\n\n\n*   _Terra Nullius_ – forced dispossession of Aboriginal people from the land\n*   Squatters denied access to waterholes, hunting grounds and sacred sites\n*   Private property \\\\(\\rightarrow\\\\) illegal to enter own ancestral territory – shot for doing so\n*   Imported stock e.g. cows trampled the earth and muddied water holes, introduction of pests e.g. rabbits damaged the sacred landscape\n*   Separation from Dreaming lands \\\\(\\rightarrow\\\\) lost spirituality and totemic identity\n*   Spiritual despair \\\\(\\rightarrow\\\\) slow self destruction still existing today\n*   Populations died out or dramatically declined- disease, malnutrition, alcohol dependence\n*   Managing to live in a manner that closely resembles the traditional ways\n*   Managing to integrate some traditional beliefs into more European way of life\n\n_Separation from kinship groups_\n\n\n\n*   Impossible to detach individuals from the wider community or the Dreaming family\n*   Dispossession of people from land \\\\(\\rightarrow\\\\) breakdown of the kinship system- isolated from ancestral territory and knowledge that had unified groups\n*   Forced to forfeit their places of totemic identity and extended spiritual family\n*   Decline of indigenous language – 350-750 distinct dialects \\\\(\\rightarrow\\\\) less than 150\n*   Many Dreaming stories and myths have died out\n*   Dispassion of land and kinship groups \\\\(\\rightarrow\\\\) breakdown in the authority of elders- rapidly hastening the separation of kinship groups\n*   Without access to dreaming kin – lost ability to fulfil spiritual obligations =\n*   Could no longer unite with Dreaming family in ceremonies and rites\n\n_The Stolen Generations_\n\n\n\n*   _Protection and Assimilation Act_ – Aboriginal children were forcibly removed from families\n*   Stated was for children’s welfare – attempt to ‘breed out’ Indigenous people\n*   Families were cut off from each other – taken great distances away, had names changed, backgrounds erased\n*   Cultural genocide\n*   Devastating for Aboriginal spirituality and the psyche of those involved\n*   3x higher infant mortality\n*   3x more likely to suffer lifestyle diseases\n*   6x higher unemployment rates\n*   Over representation in correctional facilities\n\n**Outline the important of the following for the Land Rights movement:**\n\n_Native Title_\n\n\n\n*   _Terra Nullius_ extinguished Native Title Acts under state and federal laws\n*   NT recognises the rights of Indigenous peoples in relation to the areas of land and water belonging to their particular ancestral tribes and the validity of Aboriginal territorial laws already existing prior to European settlement\n*   While not giving actual land ownership title to Indigenous peoples it allows some access to ancestral lands\n*   Facilitates use of land for spiritual and ceremonial etc\n*   Woodward Royal Commission – first gov’t inquiry to appreciate the crucial link between Aboriginal spirituality and the land\n*   _Racial Discrimination Act 1975_ –minority racial groups entitled to the same privileges and rights\n*   _Aboriginal Land Rights Act 1976_ – endorsed limited recognition of Indigenous people’s rights to the land\n*   _Native Title Act_ gave official recognition to the Indigenous way of life, particularly its spiritual connection with the land prior to European settlement\n\n_Mabo_\n\n\n\n*   **1982**: Mabo and a group of others took QLD gov’t to court, wanting legal recognition of their land as their families had lived there since ‘time immemorial’\n*   The deep spiritual significance was emphasised by the fact that Mabo repeatedly quoted stories and morals associated with his ancestral deity ‘Malo the Law Giver’\n*   Lost in the Supreme Court, took it to the High Court and Federal Parliament passed the _Native Title Act_\n\n_Wik_\n\n\n\n*   **1996**: The Wik people of Cape York brought a case to the High Court arguing their right to Native Title on local pastoral land\n*   High Court ruled in their favour and decided that Native Title rights and the rights of pastoral leaseholders could exist simultaneously\n*   **1998**: _Native Title Amendment Act_ – increased the power of the state gov’t over Native Title claims, reducing the rights of Aboriginals to negotiate directly with pastoral leaseholders\n*   **2006**: _Native Title Amendment Act_ – aims to make the Native Title process ‘more efficient’ and to hasten the processing of the active claims that are awaiting determination\n\n**Analyse the importance of the Dreaming for the Land Rights movement**\n\n\n\n*   Despite over 70% of Indigenous Australians claiming adherence to Christianity- has not diminished sense of ‘country’ and Dreaming connection to land\n*   Restored access to ancestral land that enabled the Dreaming to become dynamic reality once again\n*   Existence of Dreaming site and the possession of Dreaming knowledge forms the basis of Land Rights claims under the Land Rights and Native Title laws\n*   Demonstration of an ongoing affiliation with the land necessary for proof of entitlement – stories, songs, dances and sacred objects\n*   Difficulties with secret Dreaming sites – reluctant to reveal whereabouts to invasive scrutiny of the courts\n*   Issue – much of the evidence is based on oral tradition – can be dismissed as simple folklore or considered non objective and unreliable\n*   Dreaming legends may have adapted to incorporate Christian motifs and experiences\n\n\n\n\n## Religious Expression in Australia – 1945 to the

respond to the needs of people today\n    *   Concept of something well tried and yet new and different in important\n    *   Spread out due to the support of celebrities\n\n_Secularism_\n\n\n\n*   Any movement or concept, which rejects religious belief or adherence\n*   **1971**: ‘No Religion’ category included on census – explains rapid increase at the time\n*   Secular systems based on reason, fact and scientific analysis and therefore, differ from religious systems, which tend to be based on divine revelation and spiritual insight\n*   However, today there is less emphasis on conforming and more emphasis on the autonomy of the individual to determine what feels spiritually right to them\n*   Increased freedom – rise of secularism and the understanding that religion is essentially a private concern\n\n\n### Religious Dialogue in Multi-Faith Australia: ecumenical movements within Christianity, interfaith dialogue, the relationship between Aboriginal spiritualities and religious traditions in the process of Reconciliation\n\n**Describe the impact of Christian ecumenical movements in Australia**\n\n\n\n*   Ecumenism refers to the movement towards religious unity among Christian denominations\n*   Acknowledgement that unity in Christ outweighs the diversity in practice and beliefs in Christianity\n*   Developing opportunities to work, worship and dialogue together\n\nThe National Council of Churches Australia (NCCA)\n\n\n\n*   Formed 1994\n*   Grew from the previous Australian Council of Churches\n*   Comprised of 19 member churches representing the

traditions\n*   Allowing different religions to come to a better appreciation of the uniqueness of each other\n*   Education to dispel fear and bigotry\n*   Seeking opportunities to work together on key issues i.e. asylum seekers\n*   Allows religions to come to a better understanding of each other which increases tolerance e.g. education programs run of the ACCJ and State Bodies, Interfaith Iftar 2012 by Affinity Intercultural\n*   Promotes religion as having an important role, even in our increasingly secular Australian society\n*   Promotes shared prayer and spirituality in times of crisis i.e. the Port Arthur Massacre or the Bali Bombings\n*   Creates respect and appreciation for religious diversity which is essential for harmony and peace\n*   Has worked to break down the

reconciliation across the Sydney Harbour Bridge\n","slug":"sor1-hsc-consolidation-1","published":1,"updated":"2019-11-27T10:00:22.355Z","_id":"ck3f7y7w9002zizvc4e4s56rq","layout":"post","photos":[],"link":"","content":"<h2>Contemporary Aboriginal Spirituality</h2>\n<h3>Aboriginal Spirituality as Determined by the Dreaming</h3>\n<p><strong>Discuss how Aboriginal spirituality is determined by the Dreaming</strong></p>\n<p><em>Kinship</em></p>\n<ul>\n<li>The Dreaming – underpins all aspects of Aboriginal spirituality and traditional life</li>\n<li>Kinship – fabric of traditional Aboriginal

totem</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Spirit ancestors:\n<ul>\n<li>Expect the members of these kinship groups to fulfil certain obligations</li>\n<li>Required to obey tribal laws and beliefs and to subordinate individual interests to the greater good of the community</li>\n<li>Reciprocal network of giving and receiving of right and obligations</li>\n<li>Expect the knowledge will be passed down through the tribe</li>\n<li>Require the kinship group to act as custodians of designated territory and totems</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Ceremonial life</em></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Aboriginal ceremonies always reaffirm the Dreaming</li>\n<li>Vital – event happened in the past – also believed to be happening in the present</li>\n<li>Usually recreate a moment of the Dreaming – allow participants to spiritually transform</li>\n<li>Obliged to take part – acknowledge the Dreaming events and show the ongoing metaphysical presence of the parallel Dreaming world</li>\n<li>Connected to spirituality as it is the expression of spirituality</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Obligations to the land and people</em></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Land, people and Dreaming- one symbiotic relationship –cannot exist without each other</li>\n<li>Comprise a complex system of reciprocal obligations and rights – contribute to the ongoing physical and spiritual wellbeing of each other</li>\n<li>Sacred duty to assist the land in ‘living’ to its potential – performance of ceremonies and rituals</li>\n<li>The land has certain obligations – provides the necessary tools for performing ceremonies e.g. body decorations derived from the natural landscape</li>\n<li>Inseparable and timeless connection with land – often regard land as mother</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Issues for Aboriginal Spiritualties in Relation to: the effect of dispossession and the Land Rights movement</h3>\n<p><strong>Discuss the continuing effect of dispossession on Aboriginal spiritualities in relation to:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Only make up 7.2% of Aus. population</li>\n<li>Lower life expectancy – males- 67, females- 72</li>\n<li>Higher incarceration rates – 20% prison population</li>\n<li>High unemployment rates – 20% of indigenous population</li>\n<li>5x avg. in drug induced mental disorders</li>\n<li>2x avg. schizophrenia</li>\n<li>2-3x avg. suicide</li>\n<li>Higher rates of homelessness – 9% of indigenous population</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Separation from the land</em></p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Terra Nullius</em> – forced dispossession of Aboriginal people from the land</li>\n<li>Squatters denied access to waterholes, hunting grounds and sacred sites</li>\n<li>Private property \\(\\rightarrow\\) illegal to enter own ancestral territory – shot for doing so</li>\n<li>Imported stock e.g. cows trampled the earth and muddied water holes, introduction of pests e.g. rabbits damaged the sacred landscape</li>\n<li>Separation from Dreaming lands \\(\\rightarrow\\) lost spirituality and totemic identity</li>\n<li>Spiritual despair \\(\\rightarrow\\) slow self destruction still existing today</li>\n<li>Populations died out or dramatically declined- disease, malnutrition, alcohol dependence</li>\n<li>Managing to live in a manner that closely resembles the traditional ways</li>\n<li>Managing to integrate some traditional beliefs into more European way of life</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Separation from kinship groups</em></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Impossible to detach individuals from the wider community or the Dreaming family</li>\n<li>Dispossession of people from land \\(\\rightarrow\\) breakdown of the kinship system- isolated from ancestral territory and knowledge that had unified groups</li>\n<li>Forced to forfeit their places of totemic identity and extended spiritual family</li>\n<li>Decline of indigenous language – 350-750 distinct dialects \\(\\rightarrow\\) less than 150</li>\n<li>Many Dreaming stories and myths have died out</li>\n<li>Dispassion of land and kinship groups \\(\\rightarrow\\) breakdown in the authority of elders- rapidly hastening the separation of kinship groups</li>\n<li>Without access to dreaming kin – lost ability to fulfil spiritual obligations =</li>\n<li>Could no longer unite with Dreaming family in ceremonies and rites</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>The Stolen Generations</em></p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Protection and Assimilation Act</em> – Aboriginal children were forcibly removed from families</li>\n<li>Stated was for children’s welfare – attempt to ‘breed out’ Indigenous people</li>\n<li>Families were cut off from each other – taken great distances away, had names changed, backgrounds erased</li>\n<li>Cultural genocide</li>\n<li>Devastating for Aboriginal spirituality and the psyche of those involved</li>\n<li>3x higher infant mortality</li>\n<li>3x more likely to suffer lifestyle diseases</li>\n<li>6x higher unemployment rates</li>\n<li>Over representation in correctional facilities</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Outline the important of the following for the Land Rights movement:</strong></p>\n<p><em>Native Title</em></p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Terra Nullius</em> extinguished Native Title Acts under state and federal laws</li>\n<li>NT recognises the rights of Indigenous peoples in relation to the areas of land and water belonging to their particular ancestral tribes and the validity of Aboriginal territorial laws already existing prior to European settlement</li>\n<li>While not giving actual land ownership title to Indigenous peoples it allows some access to ancestral lands</li>\n<li>Facilitates use of land for spiritual and ceremonial etc</li>\n<li>Woodward Royal Commission – first gov’t inquiry to appreciate the crucial link between Aboriginal spirituality and the land</li>\n<li><em>Racial Discrimination Act 1975</em> –minority racial groups entitled to the same privileges and rights</li>\n<li><em>Aboriginal Land Rights Act 1976</em> – endorsed limited recognition of Indigenous people’s rights to the land</li>\n<li><em>Native Title Act</em> gave official recognition to the Indigenous way of life, particularly its spiritual connection with the land prior to European settlement</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Mabo</em></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>1982</strong>: Mabo and a group of others took QLD gov’t to court, wanting legal recognition of their land as their families had lived there since ‘time immemorial’</li>\n<li>The deep spiritual significance was emphasised by the fact that Mabo repeatedly quoted stories and morals associated with his ancestral deity ‘Malo the Law Giver’</li>\n<li>Lost in the Supreme Court, took it to the High Court and Federal Parliament passed the <em>Native Title Act</em></li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Wik</em></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>1996</strong>: The Wik people of Cape York brought a case to the High Court arguing their right to Native Title on local pastoral land</li>\n<li>High Court ruled in their favour and decided that Native Title rights and the rights of pastoral leaseholders could exist simultaneously</li>\n<li><strong>1998</strong>: <em>Native Title Amendment Act</em> – increased the power of the state gov’t over Native Title claims, reducing the rights of Aboriginals to negotiate directly with pastoral leaseholders</li>\n<li><strong>2006</strong>: <em>Native Title Amendment Act</em> – aims to make the Native Title process ‘more efficient’ and to hasten the processing of the active claims that are awaiting determination</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Analyse the importance of the Dreaming for the Land Rights movement</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Despite over 70% of Indigenous Australians claiming adherence to Christianity- has not diminished sense of ‘country’ and Dreaming connection to land</li>\n<li>Restored access to ancestral land that enabled the Dreaming to become dynamic reality once again</li>\n<li>Existence of Dreaming site and the possession of Dreaming knowledge forms the basis of Land Rights claims under the Land Rights and Native Title laws</li>\n<li>Demonstration of an ongoing affiliation with the land necessary for proof of entitlement – stories, songs, dances and sacred objects</li>\n<li>Difficulties with secret Dreaming sites – reluctant to reveal whereabouts to invasive scrutiny of the courts</li>\n<li>Issue – much of the evidence is based on oral tradition – can be dismissed as simple folklore or considered non objective and unreliable</li>\n<li>Dreaming legends may have adapted to incorporate Christian motifs and experiences</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Religious Expression in Australia – 1945 to the present</h2>\n<h3>The Religious Landscape from 1945 to the

spirituality</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Obligations to the land and people</em></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Land, people and Dreaming- one symbiotic relationship –cannot exist without each other</li>\n<li>Comprise a complex system of reciprocal obligations and rights – contribute to the ongoing physical and spiritual wellbeing of each other</li>\n<li>Sacred duty to assist the land in ‘living’ to its potential – performance of ceremonies and rituals</li>\n<li>The land has certain obligations – provides the necessary tools for performing ceremonies e.g. body decorations derived from the natural landscape</li>\n<li>Inseparable and timeless connection with land – often regard land as mother</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Issues for Aboriginal Spiritualties in Relation to: the effect of dispossession and the Land Rights movement</h3>\n<p><strong>Discuss the continuing effect of dispossession on Aboriginal spiritualities in relation to:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Only make up 7.2% of Aus. population</li>\n<li>Lower life expectancy – males- 67, females- 72</li>\n<li>Higher incarceration rates – 20% prison population</li>\n<li>High unemployment rates – 20% of indigenous population</li>\n<li>5x avg. in drug induced mental disorders</li>\n<li>2x avg. schizophrenia</li>\n<li>2-3x avg. suicide</li>\n<li>Higher rates of homelessness – 9% of indigenous population</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Separation from the land</em></p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Terra Nullius</em> – forced dispossession of Aboriginal people from the land</li>\n<li>Squatters denied access to waterholes, hunting grounds and sacred sites</li>\n<li>Private property \\(\\rightarrow\\) illegal to enter own ancestral territory – shot for doing so</li>\n<li>Imported stock e.g. cows trampled the earth and muddied water holes, introduction of pests e.g. rabbits damaged the sacred landscape</li>\n<li>Separation from Dreaming lands \\(\\rightarrow\\) lost spirituality and totemic identity</li>\n<li>Spiritual despair \\(\\rightarrow\\) slow self destruction still existing today</li>\n<li>Populations died out or dramatically declined- disease, malnutrition, alcohol dependence</li>\n<li>Managing to live in a manner that closely resembles the traditional ways</li>\n<li>Managing to integrate some traditional beliefs into more European way of life</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Separation from kinship groups</em></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Impossible to detach individuals from the wider community or the Dreaming family</li>\n<li>Dispossession of people from land \\(\\rightarrow\\) breakdown of the kinship system- isolated from ancestral territory and knowledge that had unified groups</li>\n<li>Forced to forfeit their places of totemic identity and extended spiritual family</li>\n<li>Decline of indigenous language – 350-750 distinct dialects \\(\\rightarrow\\) less than 150</li>\n<li>Many Dreaming stories and myths have died out</li>\n<li>Dispassion of land and kinship groups \\(\\rightarrow\\) breakdown in the authority of elders- rapidly hastening the separation of kinship groups</li>\n<li>Without access to dreaming kin – lost ability to fulfil spiritual obligations =</li>\n<li>Could no longer unite with Dreaming family in ceremonies and rites</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>The Stolen Generations</em></p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Protection and Assimilation Act</em> – Aboriginal children were forcibly removed from families</li>\n<li>Stated was for children’s welfare – attempt to ‘breed out’ Indigenous people</li>\n<li>Families were cut off from each other – taken great distances away, had names changed, backgrounds erased</li>\n<li>Cultural genocide</li>\n<li>Devastating for Aboriginal spirituality and the psyche of those involved</li>\n<li>3x higher infant mortality</li>\n<li>3x more likely to suffer lifestyle diseases</li>\n<li>6x higher unemployment rates</li>\n<li>Over representation in correctional facilities</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Outline the important of the following for the Land Rights movement:</strong></p>\n<p><em>Native Title</em></p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Terra Nullius</em> extinguished Native Title Acts under state and federal laws</li>\n<li>NT recognises the rights of Indigenous peoples in relation to the areas of land and water belonging to their particular ancestral tribes and the validity of Aboriginal territorial laws already existing prior to European settlement</li>\n<li>While not giving actual land ownership title to Indigenous peoples it allows some access to ancestral lands</li>\n<li>Facilitates use of land for spiritual and ceremonial etc</li>\n<li>Woodward Royal Commission – first gov’t inquiry to appreciate the crucial link between Aboriginal spirituality and the land</li>\n<li><em>Racial Discrimination Act 1975</em> –minority racial groups entitled to the same privileges and rights</li>\n<li><em>Aboriginal Land Rights Act 1976</em> – endorsed limited recognition of Indigenous people’s rights to the land</li>\n<li><em>Native Title Act</em> gave official recognition to the Indigenous way of life, particularly its spiritual connection with the land prior to European settlement</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Mabo</em></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>1982</strong>: Mabo and a group of others took QLD gov’t to court, wanting legal recognition of their land as their families had lived there since ‘time immemorial’</li>\n<li>The deep spiritual significance was emphasised by the fact that Mabo repeatedly quoted stories and morals associated with his ancestral deity ‘Malo the Law Giver’</li>\n<li>Lost in the Supreme Court, took it to the High Court and Federal Parliament passed the <em>Native Title Act</em></li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Wik</em></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>1996</strong>: The Wik people of Cape York brought a case to the High Court arguing their right to Native Title on local pastoral land</li>\n<li>High Court ruled in their favour and decided that Native Title rights and the rights of pastoral leaseholders could exist simultaneously</li>\n<li><strong>1998</strong>: <em>Native Title Amendment Act</em> – increased the power of the state gov’t over Native Title claims, reducing the rights of Aboriginals to negotiate directly with pastoral leaseholders</li>\n<li><strong>2006</strong>: <em>Native Title Amendment Act</em> – aims to make the Native Title process ‘more efficient’ and to hasten the processing of the active claims that are awaiting determination</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Analyse the importance of the Dreaming for the Land Rights movement</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Despite over 70% of Indigenous Australians claiming adherence to Christianity- has not diminished sense of ‘country’ and Dreaming connection to land</li>\n<li>Restored access to ancestral land that enabled the Dreaming to become dynamic reality once again</li>\n<li>Existence of Dreaming site and the possession of Dreaming knowledge forms the basis of Land Rights claims under the Land Rights and Native Title laws</li>\n<li>Demonstration of an ongoing affiliation with the land necessary for proof of entitlement – stories, songs, dances and sacred objects</li>\n<li>Difficulties with secret Dreaming sites – reluctant to reveal whereabouts to invasive scrutiny of the courts</li>\n<li>Issue – much of the evidence is based on oral tradition – can be dismissed as simple folklore or considered non objective and unreliable</li>\n<li>Dreaming legends may have adapted to incorporate Christian motifs and experiences</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Religious Expression in Australia – 1945 to the present</h2>\n<h3>The Religious Landscape from 1945 to the

title=\"image_tooltip\"></p>\n<p><strong>Account for the present religious landscape in Australia in relation to:</strong></p>\n<p><em>Christianity as the major religious religious tradition</em></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Christianity has been and still is the major religion in Australia</li>\n<li>Post WWII, Australia counted 88% of its population as Christian</li>\n<li>Today, 64% of Australian identify as Christian</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Immigration</em></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Post 1945, the Christian face of Australian society changed dramatically due to the immigration of people fleeing Europe</li>\n<li>Migrant – huge boost to numbers of Roman Catholics and Eastern Orthodox adherents in Aus.</li>\n<li>Roman Catholicism boosted almost 6% between 1947 and 1966</li>\n<li>Eastern Orthodox rose from 0.2% to 3% between 1947 and 1981 – large influx of Greek immigrants</li>\n<li>Small influx of Jews – reflected as 0.3% to 0.5% between 1933 to 1966</li>\n<li>More recent waves of Jewish migration to Aus. – almost 17% of Jewish population arrived after 1980</li>\n<li>1976 – Islam became present in Aus. 0.3%</li>\n<li>Between 1966 and 2006 Islamic population risen 69.4% due to immigration from Bosnia, Somalia and Ethiopia</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Denominational switching</em></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Many people are no longer making life long commitments to one church – more likely to go wherever they feel comfortable and well catered for</li>\n<li>Within Christian denominations – dramatic swing away from more liberal churches towards more conservative churches</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Rise of New Age religions</em></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Among the fastest growing faiths in the 2011 census increasing by 140% since 1996</li>\n<li>Differ from traditional faiths in that, while they form an overall spiritual movement they lack any unifying creed or doctrine</li>\n<li>Regardless, adherents tend to share some similar beliefs and practices</li>\n<li>Why?\n<ul>\n<li>A reaction against what is seen as a failure of Christianity and other mainstream religions to satisfactorily respond to the needs of people today</li>\n<li>Concept of something well tried and yet new and different in important</li>\n<li>Spread out due to the support of celebrities</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Secularism</em></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Any movement or concept, which rejects religious belief or adherence</li>\n<li><strong>1971</strong>: ‘No Religion’ category included on census – explains rapid increase at the time</li>\n<li>Secular systems based on reason, fact and scientific analysis and therefore, differ from religious systems, which tend to be based on divine revelation and spiritual insight</li>\n<li>However, today there is less emphasis on conforming and more emphasis on the autonomy of the individual to determine what feels spiritually right to them</li>\n<li>Increased freedom – rise of secularism and the understanding that religion is essentially a private concern</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Religious Dialogue in Multi-Faith Australia: ecumenical movements within Christianity, interfaith dialogue, the relationship between Aboriginal spiritualities and religious traditions in the process of Reconciliation</h3>\n<p><strong>Describe the impact of Christian ecumenical movements in Australia</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Ecumenism refers to the movement towards religious unity among Christian denominations</li>\n<li>Acknowledgement that unity in Christ outweighs the diversity in practice and beliefs in Christianity</li>\n<li>Developing opportunities to work, worship and dialogue together</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The National Council of Churches Australia (NCCA)</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Formed 1994</li>\n<li>Grew from the previous Australian Council of Churches</li>\n<li>Comprised of 19 member churches representing the Catholic, Anglican, Orthodox and Protestant expressions of Christianity</li>\n<li>Works in partnership with state ecumenical councils and it operates through various commissions each which deals with a specific sphere of influence</li>\n<li>Faith and unity: week of prayer for Christian Unity</li>\n<li>Social justice network: annual social justice statements on pressing issues i.e. environment, peace, prisons etc</li>\n</ul>\n<p>NSW Ecumenical Council</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Fellowship of 14 Protestant and Orthodox churches in NSW and ACT</li>\n<li>Maintaining “the unity of the Spirit in the bonds of peace” Ephesians 4:3</li>\n<li>Being committed to the Gospel</li>\n<li>Proclaiming it together, and living out the implications of the Gospel for service in the world</li>\n<li>Taize Pilgrimage:\n<ul>\n<li>Hosted visits fro a brother from the Taize Community in France, as part of our churches’ common commitment to a spirituality of peace and reconciliation</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Peace and Justice Commission:\n<ul>\n<li>Works to enhance outcomes for asylum seekers \\</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Evaluate the important of interfaith dialogue in multi-faith Australia</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Formal discussion aimed towards developing greater mutual understanding between different religious traditions</li>\n<li>Allowing different religions to come to a better appreciation of the uniqueness of each other</li>\n<li>Education to dispel fear and bigotry</li>\n<li>Seeking opportunities to work together on key issues i.e. asylum seekers</li>\n<li>Allows religions to come to a better understanding of each other which increases tolerance e.g. education programs run of the ACCJ and State Bodies, Interfaith Iftar 2012 by Affinity Intercultural</li>\n<li>Promotes religion as having an important role, even in our increasingly secular Australian society</li>\n<li>Promotes shared prayer and spirituality in times of crisis i.e. the Port Arthur Massacre or the Bali Bombings</li>\n<li>Creates respect and appreciation for religious diversity which is essential for harmony and peace</li>\n<li>Has worked to break down the stereotypes and prejudice towards Muslims which has been overtly prevalent in Australia since 9/11 and the Cronulla Riots</li>\n<li>Can build relationships between different religions so they can more often and more effectively speak out on common issues and uphold shared values i.e. the dignity of the person, the sanctity of human life, care for those in need, justice and peace</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Examine the relationship between Aboriginal spiritualities and religious traditions in the process of Reconciliation</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Christian churches are now actively involved in promoting Aboriginal reconciliation, both at an individual and an ecumenical level</li>\n<li>Catholic Church is a strong supporter of Aboriginal reconciliation</li>\n<li>Church leaders have committed the Catholic community to addressing the injustice and disadvantage facing Aboriginal people</li>\n<li>Actively work in an advocacy role to dismantle or reform social structures, processes and institutions, which are a source of injustice and disadvantage to the Aboriginal community</li>\n<li>Position of the Anglican Church on Aboriginal reconciliation to similar to that of the Catholic Church – recognise the importance of Aboriginal spirituality</li>\n<li>1988: Anglican Church officially apologised for the hurt inflicted upon Aboriginal people and ten years later the General Synod formally apologised to the Stolen Generations</li>\n<li>Christian Churches work together to collectively assist the Aboriginal community to reclaim its spirituality</li>\n<li>Examples:\n<ul>\n<li><strong>National Reconciliation Week</strong>: aims to give people across Australia, of all religions, the opportunity to focus on reconciliation</li>\n<li><strong>Corroboree 2000</strong>: hundred of thousands of people from across Australia joined to walk for reconciliation across the Sydney Harbour Bridge</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n","eyeCatchImage":"https://schoolnotes.intranet.pw/amp-dist/sample/sample-substituteTitleImage.png","titleImageForAmp":"/amp-dist/sample/sample-substituteTitleImage.png","eyeCatchImageProperty":{"width":1024,"height":800}},{"title":"Sponsors","date":"2017-08-04T18:39:34.000Z","draft":false,"exclude_search":true,"discussionId":"sponsors1","_content":"##

Markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)\n  - If you are writing up mathematics pages, format math stuff using MathJax ([Guide](https://math.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/5020/mathjax-basic-tutorial-and-quick-reference))\n### Formatting Rules:\n- Header Block:\n  - Title should be structured as: `Subject - Topic - Year Level (optional)`\n  - For example: `SOR1 - Core Ethical Teachings of Judaism - Year 11`\n  - If you are a writer for the site, you will be provided with a writer ID. In the header of each post, add the line `discussionId: writer_id-post_number`\n  - For example: `W1234-P10` where `W1234` is the writer ID and `P10` is the 10th post by that writer.\n  - Anonymous posts should use writer ID `WA1` with no post number. A post number will be assigned randomly after moderation. Identified writers will only be moderated for the first post, and randomly after that.\n- Post Contents:\n  - DO NOT REPEAT THE TOPIC!!!\n  - Syllabus points and learning intentions should be placed at the end of the post (Optional but recommended)\n  - Subheadings start from h2 (##). Every sub-sub heading should have another # added to it.\n    - For example, on this page, `How to write posts` is h2 (##). `Formatting Rules` is h3 (###). More #'s means another sub-topic.\n    - If a component has 3 or more subheadings, it should probably be a separate post.\n  - Break down the information into dot points (i.e. lines should start with a dash `-` or an asterisk `*`).\n  - No more than 2 sentences per dot point.\n  - You CAN stack points by indenting them (add a space before the dash/asterisk).\n    - If a point has more than 3 indents, it should probably have its own heading.\n    - Stacked points can be used to elaborate or define key points/terms (HIGHLY RECOMMENDED)\n  - Images/diagrams can be used, and are recommended for subjects such as sciences, math and TAS subjects (Art, music, technology, STEM, etc.)\n  - Include a table of definitions and Subject-Specific Terminology (If needed) at the end of the post. Also include your name and best contact email. (See sample Markdown document)\n    - Tables should be in HTML due to a bug in the render engine.

A is the atomic number (number of protons)\n    - E is the Atomic symbol (1 or 2 letter symbol of the element)\n- Isotopes can be unstable: the number of protons and neutrons in the nucleus of the atom is unbalanced, so the isotope is RADIOACTIVE\n## Radiation\n\n<blockquote> Radiation is the emission of energy as electromagnetic waves or as moving subatomic particles, especially high-energy particles which cause ionization.\n</blockquote>\n\n- Radiation is created when an unstable isotope emits energy in the form of Alpha, Beta or Gamma particles\n- IONIZING RADIATION is any form of radiation that has the ability to make an atom ionized (positively or negatively charged)\n- BACKGROUND RADIATION is any radiation that is present in the environment without adding any intentional sources\n### Types of Radiation\n- Alpha (α) radiation (Two protons and two neutrons bound together)\n\t- Alpha particles are created when an atom has too many protons\n    - The cell emits two protons and two electrons, and the resulting atom is 2 atomic numbers lower\n    - Alpha particles can be stopped by a sheet of paper, or by skin, or a few centimetres of air\n- Beta (β) radiation (Single electron or single positron)\n\t- Beta particles are created when an atom has too many neutrons\n    - One of the neutrons decays into one proton and one electron or positron\n    - The resulting atom is one atomic number higher\n    - Beta particles can be stopped by a sheet of aluminum, or 100cm of air\n- Gamma (γ) radiation (high energy electromagnetic wave)\n\t- Gamma radiation is created when an atom needs to lose excess energy\n    - The atom releases a high-energy photon known as a GAMMA RAY\n    - The atom's atomic number and mass do not change\n    - Gamma Rays can be stopped by 100m thick concrete, or 40cm of lead\n- Neutron (n) radiation (Single neutron)\n\t- Neutron radiation is created as a product of nuclear fusion or fission, where the product(s) does not require the extra neutron\n    - The reaction releases a neutron (or multiple neutrons)\n    - Neutron radiation is a byproduct of nuclear reactions, so the change in atomic mass and number depends on the reaction. However, the total mass of the resulting atom(s) is one less than the total mass of the reactant(s)\n    - Neutron radiation can be stopped by boron, hydrocarbons, water, or large blocks of

Sharma\ntags:\n  - Year 10\n  - Physics\n  - Radiation\ncategories:\n  - Year 10\n  - Physics\ndate: 2019-12-04 15:43:00\n---\n- As learnt in the Chemistry topic, every atom of the same element has the same number of protons (atomic number)\n- However, the number of Neutrons can be different, but it will still be the same element.\n- Atoms of the same element, but with different numbers of neutrons are known as ISOTOPES\n- For example, Hydrogen comes in three forms:\n\t- Protium (normal hydrogen) with one proton and No Neutrons\n    - Deuterium, which has one proton and one neutron\n    - Tritium (artificially made), which has one proton and two neutrons\n    - All of these are different isotopes of the same element (Hydrogen), as shown in the image below\n![Forms of Hydrogen](/images/forms-of-hydrogen1.png)\n- The symbols of isotopes are written in the form \\\\( \\ce{^{M}_{A}E} \\\\) where:\n\t- M is the mass number (number of protons + number of electrons)\n    - A is the atomic number (number of protons)\n    - E is the Atomic symbol (1 or 2 letter symbol of the element)\n- Isotopes can be unstable: the number of protons and neutrons in the nucleus of the atom is unbalanced, so the isotope is RADIOACTIVE\n## Radiation\n\n<blockquote> Radiation is the emission of energy as electromagnetic waves or as moving subatomic particles, especially high-energy particles which cause ionization.\n</blockquote>\n\n- Radiation is created when an unstable isotope emits energy in the form of Alpha, Beta or Gamma particles\n- IONIZING RADIATION is any form of radiation that has the ability to make an atom ionized (positively or negatively charged)\n- BACKGROUND RADIATION is any radiation that is present in the environment without adding any intentional sources\n### Types of Radiation\n- Alpha (α) radiation (Two protons and two neutrons bound together)\n\t- Alpha particles are created when an atom has too many protons\n    - The cell emits two protons and two electrons, and the resulting atom is 2 atomic numbers lower\n    - Alpha particles can be stopped by a sheet of paper, or by skin, or a few centimetres of air\n- Beta (β) radiation (Single electron or single positron)\n\t- Beta particles are created when an atom has too many neutrons\n    - One of the neutrons decays into one proton and one electron or positron\n    - The resulting atom is one atomic number higher\n    - Beta particles can be stopped by a sheet of aluminum, or 100cm of air\n- Gamma (γ) radiation (high energy electromagnetic wave)\n\t- Gamma radiation is created when an atom needs to lose excess energy\n    - The atom releases a high-energy photon known as a GAMMA RAY\n    - The atom's atomic number and mass do not change\n    - Gamma Rays can be stopped by 100m thick concrete, or 40cm of lead\n- Neutron (n) radiation (Single neutron)\n\t- Neutron radiation is created as a product of nuclear fusion or fission, where the product(s) does not require the extra neutron\n    - The reaction releases a neutron (or multiple neutrons)\n    - Neutron radiation is a byproduct of nuclear reactions, so the change in atomic mass and number depends on the reaction. However, the total mass of the resulting atom(s) is one less than the total mass of the reactant(s)\n    - Neutron radiation can be stopped by boron, hydrocarbons, water, or large blocks of concrete\n### Helpful Uses For Radiation\n<style type=\"text/css\">\n.tg  {border-collapse:collapse;border-spacing:0;border-color:#93a1a1;margin:0px auto;}\n.tg td{font-family:Arial,

same element has the same number of protons (atomic number)</li>\n<li>However, the number of Neutrons can be different, but it will still be the same element.</li>\n<li>Atoms of the same element, but with different numbers of neutrons are known as ISOTOPES</li>\n<li>For example, Hydrogen comes in three forms:\n<ul>\n<li>Protium (normal hydrogen) with one proton and No Neutrons</li>\n<li>Deuterium, which has one proton and one neutron</li>\n<li>Tritium (artificially made), which has one proton and two neutrons</li>\n<li>All of these are different isotopes of the same element (Hydrogen), as shown in the image below<br>\n<img src=\"/images/forms-of-hydrogen1.png\" alt=\"Forms of Hydrogen\"></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>The symbols of isotopes are written in the form \\( \\ce{^{M}_{A}E} \\) where:\n<ul>\n<li>M is the mass number (number of protons + number of electrons)</li>\n<li>A is the atomic number (number of protons)</li>\n<li>E is the Atomic symbol (1 or 2 letter symbol of the element)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Isotopes can be unstable: the number of protons and neutrons in the nucleus of the atom is unbalanced, so the isotope is RADIOACTIVE</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Radiation</h2>\n<blockquote> Radiation is the emission of energy as electromagnetic waves or as moving subatomic particles, especially high-energy particles which cause ionization.\n</blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>Radiation is created when an unstable isotope emits energy in the form of Alpha, Beta or Gamma particles</li>\n<li>IONIZING RADIATION is any form of radiation that has the ability to make an atom ionized (positively or negatively charged)</li>\n<li>BACKGROUND RADIATION is any radiation that is present in the environment without adding any intentional sources</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Types of Radiation</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Alpha (α) radiation (Two protons and two neutrons bound together)\n<ul>\n<li>Alpha particles are created when an atom has too many protons</li>\n<li>The cell emits two protons and two electrons, and the resulting atom is 2 atomic numbers lower</li>\n<li>Alpha particles can be stopped by a sheet of paper, or by skin, or a few centimetres of air</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Beta (β) radiation (Single electron or single positron)\n<ul>\n<li>Beta particles are created when an atom has too many neutrons</li>\n<li>One of the neutrons decays into one proton and one electron or positron</li>\n<li>The resulting atom is one atomic number higher</li>\n<li>Beta particles can be stopped by a sheet of aluminum, or 100cm of air</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Gamma (γ) radiation (high energy electromagnetic wave)\n<ul>\n<li>Gamma radiation is created when an atom needs to lose excess energy</li>\n<li>The atom releases a high-energy photon known as a GAMMA RAY</li>\n<li>The atom’s atomic number and mass do not change</li>\n<li>Gamma Rays can be stopped by 100m thick concrete, or 40cm of lead</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Neutron (n) radiation (Single neutron)\n<ul>\n<li>Neutron radiation is created as a product of nuclear fusion or fission, where the product(s) does not require the extra neutron</li>\n<li>The reaction releases a neutron (or multiple neutrons)</li>\n<li>Neutron radiation is a byproduct of nuclear reactions, so the change in atomic mass and number depends on the reaction. However, the total mass of the resulting atom(s) is one less than the total mass of the reactant(s)</li>\n<li>Neutron radiation can be stopped by boron, hydrocarbons, water, or large blocks of concrete</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Helpful Uses For Radiation</h3>\n<style type=\"text/css\">\n.tg  {border-collapse:collapse;border-spacing:0;border-color:#93a1a1;margin:0px auto;}\n.tg
